In March 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) convened a meeting to identify policies and activities to promote access to vaccination of older adults, specifically in LMICs. Participants included academic and industry researchers, funders, civil society organizations, implementers of global health interventions, and stakeholders from developing countries with adult immunization needs. These experts reviewed vaccine performance in older adults, the anticipated impact of adult vaccination programs, and the challenges and opportunities of building or strengthening an adult and older adult immunization platforms. Key conclusions of the meeting were that there is a need for discussion of new opportunities for vaccination of all adults as well as for vaccination of older adults, as reflected in the recent shift by WHO to a life-course approach to immunization; that immunization in adults should be viewed in the context of a much broader model based on an individual's abilities rather than chronological age; and that immunization beyond infancy is a global priority that can be successfully integrated with other interventions to promote healthy ageing. As WHO is looking ahead to a global Decade of Healthy Ageing starting in 2020, it will seek to define a roadmap for interdisciplinary collaborations to integrate immunization with improving access to preventive and other healthcare interventions for adults worldwide.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"INTRODUCTION\\n\\nIt is well documented that infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) produces a nephritis in chickens in natural outbreaks of disease (Winterfield and Hitchner, 1962; Cumming, 1963; Julian and Willis, 1969) . Many factors such as cold stress, nutrition, and age and sex of the chicken influence the mortality in an outbreak (Cumming, 1965; Sinkovic and Gilchrist, 1967; Macdonald, Randall and McMartin, 1980) . Those strains of virus which induce more severe kidney disease are also associated with higher mortality rates (Siller and Cumming, 1974; Chong and Apostolov, 1982) .In a study of the chemical pathology of infectious bronchitis nephritis, Heath (1970) attributed death of the chicken to kidney dysfunction and acute renal failure. Several histological investigations of the development of kidney lesions through the course of experimental infections have shown interstitial inflammatory reactions and tubular degeneration occurring in both proximal and distal segments of the nephron (Siller and Cumming, 1974; Pohl, 1974; Purcell, Tham and Surman, 1976) . Chong and Apostolov ( 1982) ) by immuno-fluoresence, demonstrated the presence of viral antigen in all segments of tubules, but the staining was mainly confined to the proximal tubules. These workers incriminated the replication of the virus in the tubular epithelium as a direct cause of the disease. This paper presents a quantitative morphological analysis of the changes in structure of the proximal tubular epithelial cells over the course of an experimental infection with IBV. MATERIALS AND METHODS\\n\\nExperimental Birds\\n\\nSixteen 3-week-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) Webster-Mini crossbred chickens were supplied by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Animal Health Division. Regular monitoring and serological testing have shown the birds from this isolation unit to be free from a wide range of mycoplasma, bacteria and viruses. The \\\"T\\\" strain of IBV (Winterfield, Cumming and Hitchner, 1964) was obtained from Dr T. Faragher, National Biological Standards Laboratory, Parkville, Victoria. The virus was passaged once in embryonated (SPF) eggs and the allantoic fluid, harvested at day 12, was stored in 1 ml aliquots at -70 \\\"C. In subsequent egg inoculation studies' the titre of IBV was found to be 3 x lo4 EID,, per ml.\\n\\nPlan of Experiment\\n\\nBirds were placed in a controlled temperature room at 12 \\\"C to induce cold stress. After 3 days, 4 control birds were anaesthetized and the left kidney was perfused with fixative via the renal portal vein. The remaining birds were inoculated with 10 ~1 of the viral suspension into both conjunctival sacs. At 4 day intervals thereafter, kidneys were fixed from groups of 4 birds.\\n\\nTissue Processing\\n\\nKidneys were perfused for at least 3 min under 90 cm hydrostatic pressure with a fixative consisting of 1.5 per cent glutaraldehyde, 1 per cent formaldehyde and 1.2 per cent glucose in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. Osmotic pressure of the buffer and glucose was 265 mOs per kg and the fixative was 540 mOs per kg. The pH was 7.4. The renal vein was sectioned and the portal valve was clamped. Acceptable perfusion was indicated if the kidney became pale and turgid. The kidney was then immediately removed from the bird, cut into 1 mm slices and placed in the same fixative for 1 h at 0 \\\"C. Tissue was washed in buffer 3 times and post-fixed in 1 per cent osmium tetroxide for 1 h, block stained with 2 per cent aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 h, dehydrated and embedded in Spurr's firm resin (Spurr, 1969) . Specimens for sectioning were selected at random and the criteria for adequate fixation were that the lumens of the proximal tubules were open, the microvilli were regularly arranged and the apical border of the cell was straight, with no protrusion into the lumen (Maunsbach, 1966a) . Silver sections 60 to 90 nm thick, from 3 blocks per bird, were collected on grids and stained with 0.3 per cent lead citrate for 3 min.For scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 1' s ices of fixed tissue were processed by the OTO method (Kelley, Dekker and Bluemink, 1975) and dried by the critical point method in CO,. The specimens were fractured, mounted on aluminium stubs and coated with 20 nm of gold.\\n\\nElectron Microscopy\\n\\nTransmission electron micrographs were taken of cells in longitudinal section (extending from the basement membrane to the lumen) from 6 different proximal tubules per section with a JEOL JEM-120.A magnification of 3600 was used for investigation of whole cells and 25 000 for detailed investigation of microvilli and organelles in the apical and basal parts of the cell. The magnification of the microscope was confirmed with a 1200 lines per mm diffraction grating replica. A JEOL JSM-T20 was used at 5 kV to take scanning electron micrographs.\\n\\nMicrographs\\n\\nwere printed with a further magnification of 3.6 and analysed with a microcomputer with a graphics tablet and an image analysis programme*. Data were collected from the digitizing tablet by tracing the outline of individual structures with a cursor for whole cell, nucleus, microvillus and extracellular space at low magnification level. At the high magnification, the following structures were analysed within a reference area overlay arbitrarily placed over the micrographs; microvillus membrane, apical tubular membrane, apical vacuoles, lysosomes, apical and basal mitochondria cristal and inner mitochondria membrane, lipid droplets and basolateral membrane. Stereological characteristics were calculated from standard formulae (Weibel, 1963; Williams, 1977) . Formfactor is the ratio, 48 x area divided by (perimeter)* which gives an estimate of shape of structures. This ratio is I.0 for a perfect circle. Nucleus profile diameter was calculated by taking the square root of the product of the diameters measured at right angles. By assuming that the nucleus was spherical, Fullman's formula (Williams, 1977 was applied to determine the mean nucleus diameter. The absolute volumes of the cell and cell components were then extrapolated from the nucleus volume and the relative volume densities.The sample size required to achieve results with confidence limits of & 10 per cent was determined from a study of normal chicken kidney (Condron, unpublished data). All values used in this investigation were measured from a large number of micrographs from 3 chickens. Progressive means were determined by including each additional observation.As a range of f 10 per cent of the final overall mean is considered adequate accuracy in biological studies, the sample size, or number of observations, needed to bring the progressive mean constantly into this range is the minimal sample required to obtain a valid estimate of a particular measurement (Burri, Giger, Gnagi and Weibel, 1968; WeibeI and Gnagi, 1968; Schroeder and Munzel-Pedrazzoli, 1970; Williams, 1977) . To increase the significance of the results the minimal sample size was exceeded with an extra animal in experimental groups, as this type of sampling has greater statistical weight than increasing the number of micrographs examined from a smaller group. The systematic subsampling employed has been shown to be a valid method of obtaining a representative unbiased measurement for morphometric analysis of a polarized tissue (Burri et al., 1968; Schroeder and Munzel-Pedrazzoli, 1970) . In order to determine the trend of the results through the course of the disease, statistical analysis for linear and quadratic regression against time was performed by applying the t-test to orthogonal polynomials (Hicks, 1973) . A further statistical comparison between groups was by the one-way analysis of variance.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nAll birds exhibited typical signs of infectious bronchitis. From day 3 onwards, the birds had ruffled feathers and were depressed.These signs were most severe between days 7 to 10 and some birds passed very fluid droppings. At day 8, the kidneys were swollen and pale, and urates were observed in the ureters. The disease produced was \\\"mild\\\" in character (Siller and Cumming, 1974) and no natural deaths occurred. Examination by light microscopy revealed a predominantly mononuclear inflammatory response.Quantitative morphological data for cellular components at the low magnification are given in Tables 1 to 3. Volume densities of the nucleus, microvillus and extracellular space relative to the total cell volume are given in Table 1 . Compared with the normal \\\"control\\\" group, the nucleus volume density tended to be reduced but this was not significant. The microvillus volume density was reduced at days 4, 8 and 12 and showed a linear regression; the extracellular space volume density was reduced at days 4 and 8 and returned to normal at day 12 with a quadratic regression. The values calculated for the absolute volume of these structures, shown in Table 2 , followed this same pattern. The reduction of microvillus volume was due to shortening and focal loss of microvilli. Estimators of cell and nucleus shapes are listed in Table 3 . There was an increase in cell formfactor at day 4 and an increase in cell maximal diameter at day 8, indicating that initially the cells became rounder and then decreased in size and became more elongated, returning to normal dimensions at day 12. The nuclear diameter remained relatively constant but there was an increase in formfactor at day 8. This rounding-up of the nucleus occurred later than similar changes in the cell.The surface density or surface area per unit volume of membrane structures is presented in Table 4 . There was a marked reduction in apical tubular membrane at day 4. This returned to normal at day 8, giving a significant quadratic regression against the shorter time interval. The relative density of microvillus membrane remained constant but the surface density per cell was reduced as the microvillus volume density decreased. Similarly, the slight increase in relative density of the basolateral membrane was overshadowed by a decrease in extracellular space, so that there was an overall decrease in the absolute surface areas of transport membranes per cell. Table 5 lists the volume densities of cytoplasmic components.After an initial reduction, there was an increase in apical vacuoles at day 8 and a progressive increase in lysosomes in the apical cytoplasm over the course of the experiment. However, these values were not significant in the statistical tests applied due to large variations between animals. A large increase in lipid droplets was observed in the base of the cells at day 4 but they were normal by day 8.There was a marked change in the distribution and shape of mitochondria. In the apical cytoplasm, there was an increase of mitochondria volume density at day 4, a decrease at day 8 and normal values at day 12. In the base of the cell, there was a decrease in mitochondria volume density which was most severe at day 8. These changes in volume density reflect changes in size and shape of individual mitochondrial profiles observed (Table 6 ). In the apical cytoplasm, with increase in volume density at day 4, the mitochondria had larger profiles which were longer and had more distorted or less rounded shapes. The subsequent decrease in volume density was accompanied by shorter, more rounded and smaller profiles towards day 12. In the basal cytoplasm, the decrease in volume density was mirrored by a decrease in size of individual profiles. The mitochondria became shorter and rounder towards day 12. The measurements related to shape were the same for apical and basal profiles at day 12. The inner mitochondrial membrane plus the cristal membrane had constant surface density per unit volume of mitochondria, but since there was a decrease in mitochondrial volume density there was a related decrease in mitochondrial membrane per cell. Figure 1 shows a typical epithelial cell from a normal chicken taken at low magnification.At day 4 (Fig. 2) , the cells tended to be more rounded. There was a decrease in apical tubular membrane and an increase in apical mitochondrial volume density. Lipid droplets were prominent at the base of the cell. Virus particles could be found in cells at day 4 (Fig. 3) . They were enclosed within irregular spaces adjacent to the nucleus by a membrane from which virus particles were budding. Figure 4 shows an epithelial cell at day 8 with focal loss of microvilli. There was also a reduction in apical mitochondria. At day 12 (Figs 7 and 8 ), mitochondria were dark and cristae were dilated. Figure 7 shows a cell with marked loss of microvilli. Vesicular spaces were prominent between cells (Fig,  8) . These spaces or \\\"holes\\\" in the cells were obvious in scanning electron micrographs (Figs 9 and IO) . Cytoplasmic inclusions into nuclei were observed at days 4,8 and 12 (Fig. 5) . Figure 6 shows a leucocyte migrating through the basement membrane and between two epithelial cells. This was common at days 8 and 12. Figures 11 and  12 show the basal part of the cell at the high magnification from a normal chicken and from a chicken at 12 days after infection, respectively.At 12 days, the mitochondria were smaller and more rounded, the mitochondrial matrix was condensed and the cristae were dilated. The endoplasmic reticulum was dilated.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nAlthough the disease reproduced in this study was mild, viral replication and kidney disease were observed and the chickens were obviously sick and depressed. The size of the infective dose, route of administration and increased egg passage are factors which are potential causes of the decreased virulence of this \\\"T\\\" strain of IBV compared to that reported by Siller and Cumming (1974) .Throughout the course of the disease, significant alterations in the structure of the functional components within the proximal tubular epithelium were observed.In particular, there was a decrease in the volume density of mitochondria and in the surface area of membrane structures. Both the microvillus membrane adjacent to the tubular lumen and the basolateral membrane adjacent to the extracellular space, which are separated by tight junctions at the apex of the cell, were reduced. The membrane available for transport of fluid and ions across the ceil was thus decreased. Within the cell, there was also a reduction in apical tubular membrane which is associated with uptake of larger molecules (Siller, 197 1) . Further evidence for change in water and ion transport is the dilated endoplasmic reticulum and the alteration in mitochondrial size and shape. The severity and degree of the changes observed correspond to stages 2 and 3 described by Trump, Croker and Mergner (1971) in their review of the pathogenesis of cell injury. These stages are compatible with cell survival but indicate a modification of cell membrane function and/or a modification of cell energy metabolism.There is a very close relationship between structure and function in membranes (Trump et al., 1971) . In studies of acute renal failure induced by ischaemia in rats, it has been shown that cells with these changes have ineffective ion and volume regulation.Glaumann, Glaumann, Berezesky and Trump ( 1975) concluded that, at this stage, sodium reabsorption by the proximal tubule must be greatly impaired.Similar alterations in the structure of cells have also been described in animals infected by coronaviruses other than IBV (Cheville, 1975; Takeuchi, Binn, Jervis, Keenan, Hildebrandt, Valas and Bland, 1976) . Measurements in short-circulated jejunal epithelia of piglets infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus have demonstrated abnormal glucose-stimulated sodium transport (Kerzner, Kelly, Gall, Butler and Hamilton, 1977) . These workers associated this impaired function with the presence of abnormal, immature villous epithelial cells which have migrated to the villi in a relatively undifferentiated state.Although there have been many recent advances in the determination of the replication strategy of coronaviruses, the mechanism of viral release has still not been clearly defined (Robb and Bond, 1979; Siddell, Wege and ter Meulen, 1982) . Evidence for cell lysis as the means of viral release has frequently been presented from studies in which the tissues have not received optimal preservation. Adequate preservation of tissue is essential to minimize fixation artefacts. Lysis and rupture of cells was not a feature of this study in which tissues were perfused with a carefully monitored fixative. Immersion fixation is unsuitable since rapid collapse of the tissue causes damage to the tubular epithelium including protrusion of the apical cytoplasm into the lumen and disruption of the microvillus border of the cells (Maunsbach, 1966a; Rothwell, 1974 Chong and Apostolov (1982) , who used immersion fixation, concluded that lysis of cells was the primary cause of nephritis induced by IBV but the type of lysis of cells which they observed may be readily produced by inadequate fixation. Doughri, Storz, Hajer and Fernando (1976) , Chasey and Alexander (1976) and Bielefeldt-Ohmann and Bloch (1982) h ave presented evidence that release of coronavirus may occur by fusion of viral-containing cytoplasmic vacuoles with the plasma membrane.Vesicular, hole-like structures in the lateral surfaces of cells which were observed by SEM are possibly the site of viral release by this mechanism of exocytosis. Release of virus by this means and survival of the infected cell to enable the further maturation of viral particles may play some part in the development of persistent infections which have been reported for some coronaviruses including IBV (Robb and Bond, 1979) . The proximal tubular epithelium has been shown to be very sensitive to differences in the osmotic pressure of fixative components (Maunsbach, 1966b; Rothwell, 1978) . Alterations in the concentrations of ions and hence of osmotic pressure initiated by IBV infection will cause changes in the osmotic differential of a fixative which is kept constant.Some of the observed changes in structure may have been related to this osmotic effect of the fixative. With more concentrated solutions, Maunsbach (1966b) observed widened extracellular spaces similar to the spaces observed at day 12, but further evidence that this is an osmotic effect, such as shrunken nuclei and densly staining cytoplasm, is lacking. These widened spaces may be related to the vesicular structures observed by SEM. Permeability of infected cells to trypan blue (Robb and Bond, 1979) may be due to these \\\"holes\\\" in the plasma membrane.Although the primary virus-cell interaction in coronavirus-caused disease is a cytocidal interaction, general cellular protein synthesis is not affected until very late in the infectious cycle (Robb and Bond, 1979) . The evidence presented in our study of structural alterations in tubular epithelial cells during the course of IBV infection indicates that impaired fluid and electrolyte transport is responsible for the kidney disease and renal failure caused by IBV. Further work (Condron and Marshall, 1985) is in progress to determine the alteration in the function of the proximal tubular epithelium and to relate it to the structural changes described in this paper. Whilst stereological methods have been used in a wide range of EM investigations of experimental pathology, to the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a morphometric analysis of ultrastructural changes in an organ induced by a viral infection. These techniques, designed to define the extent and nature of structural changes in all cells in a particular organ, can play a valuable role in determining virus-host cell interactions and the pathogenesis of viral diseases.\\n\\nSUMMARY\\n\\nThe ultrastructure of the proximal tubular epithelial cells in chicken kidneys was examined throughout the course of an experimental infection with infectious bronchitis virus. A quantitative assessment of the structural changes in the cells was related to these in normal cells.Significant alterations were detected in the membrane structures and in the mitochondria.There was a reduction in surface area of the microvillus membrane, the basolateral membrane and the apical tubular membrane. There were alterations in the shape of mitochondrial profiles and a decrease in the volume density of mitochondria.Vesicular structures, which are a possible site of viral release, were observed in the lateral surface of cells.These changes in the functional components of the cells indicate impaired transport of ions and water. The results demonstrate the value of stereological methods for the study of viral-host cell interactions in the pathogenesis of viral disease.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Introduction\\n\\nPorcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), a respiratory variant of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was first identified in Belgium in 1986 (Pensaert et al., 1986 ) . PRCV is morphologically and antigenically similar to TGEV, but it has no tropism for the gut, replicating to high titers in the respiratory tissues of the pig and not inducing intestinal disorders. Instead, it produces mild or inapparent respiratory symptoms, and it affects the growth of fattening pigs (Bourgueil et al., 1992; Lanza et al., 1992) . The humoral immune response elicited by both coronaviruses is indistinguishable (due to common neutralization epitopes) by the classical virus-neutralization test, but small antigenic differences that can be detected by monoclonal antibodies have allowed the development of differential serological tests (competitive *Corresponding author. inhibition blocking ELISA) for both viral infections (Callebaut et al., 1988a,b) .Since its first description in Belgium, PRCV infection has spread throughout Europe in a very short time, and it has been identified in the US (Wesley et al., 1990) . Despite its limited pathogenicity, the epidemiological behavior and the factors associated with PRCV infection may serve as a model for other respiratory viruses, such as Aujeszky's or influenza viruses. The purpose of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of PRCV infection in the largest Spanish region (Castilla y Le6n) and to learn about the factors related to PRCV seropositivity among swine herds.\\n\\nSampling\\n\\nThe target population was the breeding sows of seven provinces of Castilla y Le6n. Geographically, this region covers most of the NW-central part of Spain, and it is a plateau with an average altitude of 700 m above sea level. In April 1988, the breeding sow population in the sampled area was 327 972 animals (nearly 20% of the Spanish breeding sow census).Farms were classified into three different categories depending both on the number of sows and the management practices, as follows:(A) Family farms: this category included herds with 20-50 breeding sows, in which the piglets are usually sold to large fattening farms at weaning age. This type of farm is frequently found in certain parts of the sampled region and represents a secondary income source for many farmers. The production is not intensive and there is a great variability among farms in animal housing facilities, type of feed, management practices and hygienic conditions. Herds with less than 20 sows were not included in this study. (B) Small intensive farms: herds containing between 51 and 100 breeding sows, intensively managed and either performing breeding only or a farrowto-finish operation. (C) Large intensive farms: farms with more than 100 breeding sows, intensively managed, performing a farrow-to-finish operation in which management and hygiene practices, type of feed and housing facilities are very similar among farms and generally satisfactory.Fourteen family herds, 21 small intensive and 23 large intensive farms were selected and sampled. Within each herd, regardless of type, blood was taken from 20-22 sows. Each farm was sampled only once. Both herds and sows within herds were randomly selected from census data, using a random numbers generator.A total of 1247 sows were sampled throughout 1988. Based on the formula (n = Z2pq/L 2) of the approximate 95% confidence interval of the sample size for calculating the prevalence (Martin et al., 1987) the number of sows sampled allowed an absolute error (L) of 2.7% in determining the prevalence of infected animals at the 95% confidence level. As the expected prevalence (p) was unknown, 50% was chosen as the one giving the maximal sample size.Blood was allowed to clot and the serum was separated by centrifugation, coded and kept at -30 \\u00b0C until tested.\\n\\nSerological tests\\n\\nSerum samples were tested first by a monoclonal antibody-capture ELISA (MACELISA) (Lanza et al., 1993 ) , a non-discriminating method which detects antibodies against both PRCV and TGEV. The sensitivity and specificity of this test, as compared with the standard virus neutralization test are 91% and 99%, respectively. In this test, samples were tested in duplicate wells, one containing viral antigen and the other negative control antigen, obtained from mock-infected cell cultures. ELISA values for this test were calculated as the optical densities in the viral antigen wells minus those in the control antigen wells. To assess the consistency of the test, a positive and a negative standard reference serum were tested in each plate. Positive sera were subsequently tested by a competitive inhibition blocking ELISA, as described by Callebaut et al. (1988b) . This test, which uses a TGEV-specific monoclonal antibody as an indicator, specifically detects the humoral immune response produced by TGEV infection and is highly specific in detecting TGEV-seropositive pigs, its sensitivity (85%) being increased when using it on a herd basis.\\n\\nEpidemiological/statistical analysis\\n\\nThe statistical analysis was performed taking the farm as the unit of concern. In order to determine if there were differences in the behavior of PRCV infection among the different farm types that could be explained by differences in its size or management practices, the following data analyses were performed.Comparison of the prevalence of infected farms among the different herd categories. A farm was considered infected when at least one sampled sow was PRCV-seropositive. The number of PRCV-positive and -negative farms was compared among the three farm categories by the Z 2 test at a = 0.05.The occurrence of a positive correlation between herd size and within-farm seropositivity was analyzed with the Spearman's rank correlation. For this purpose, three different ranks of within-farm seropositivity were established: low (1-32%), medium (33-66%) and high (67-100%). (Dean et al., 1990 ) was used.\\n\\nResults\\n\\nBy MACELISA, 392 sows out of the 1247 samples (31.4%) were positive. These positive sera were subsequently tested by the differential blocking ELISA and all proved to be PRCV-specific. In 37 out of the 58 sampled herds (64%), at least one PRCV-seropositive sow was found.The prevalence of infected farms was very similar among the different herd categories, ranging from 59% in large intensive to 71% in family herds. No overall significant differences were found between the different herd categories regarding the prevalence of infected farms ( Table 1 ) . Mean ELISA values of sera belonging to each herd category are shown in Table 2 ; these values were similar for family and small intensive herds, but they were smaller in large intensive farms. Student's t-test showed that mean ELISA values in large intensive herds were significantly smaller than in the other two farm categories. No significant differences were found between family and small intensive herds.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nNeither TGEV nor PRCV has been previously recognized in the sampled area. In a limited sow sera survey performed with samples taken at the slaughterhouse in 1985, Rubio et al. (1987) did not detect TGEV neutralizing antibodies in any of the samples, thus ruling out the presence of both TGEV and PRCV in the area. Three years later, when our sampling was made, the situation seems to have changed completely, since 64% of the sampled farms had PRCV-seropositive sows. This confirms that PRCV spread rapidly among the swine population in Spain, similarly and concurrently to what happened in other European countries (Pensaert et al., 1986) .It is remarkable that TGEV-specific antibodies were not found in any tested animal. TGEV-specific antibodies have been found in sows of two different intensive pig-breeding areas of the Spanish Mediterranean coast (Murcia and Catalonia) (Cubero-Pablo et al., 1990 ) (M. Martin et al., personal communication, 1992 ) . Many piglets are sent from Central Europe to these Spanish regions for fattening. Furthermore, at the time of our sampling, a TGE outbreak was diagnosed in the center of Spain, in a farm which had recently imported pigs from Belgium (Laviada et al., 1988 ) . The reasons why TGE does not seem to have spread to Castilla y Le6n remain obscure, but two facts could explain it: first, the entrance of TGEV infection by means of carrier pigs from other European countries seems unlikely, since piglets are rarely imported to Castilla y Le6n from other European countries; second, the diffusion of TGEV from other parts of Spain is also unlikely, since pig trade between Castilla y Le6n and other parts of Spain is mainly based on the export of piglets which are to be fattened in large intensive units located along the Mediterranean coast. On the other hand, the spread of PRCV seems to be much easier, since it is spread by airborne transmission (Wesley et al., 1990 ).Significant differences were not found in prevalence rates across the different farm categories, suggesting that all types of farms are equally likely to be infected by the respiratory coronavirus, regardless of different management practices and probably due to the great aerogenic diffusion capacity of this virus. On the other hand, we found a very strong correlation between increasing farm size and increasing within-farm seropositivity, indicating that the transmission of this respiratory infection is easier within large animal popu-lations. Henningsen et al. ( 1988 ) in Denmark, found that the probability of a pig being PRCV-seropositive increased while increasing the herd size.Mean ELISA values were significantly lower in large intensive farms than in the rest, which might be explained by higher replacement rate of the sows in this type of farm, while smaller herds tend to keep the breeding animals for a longer time, thus increasing the probability of PRCV re-infections, which causes higher amounts of specific antibodies in serum and then higher ELISA values.This study probably detected the beginning of a PRCV epidemic in the area, leading to a pandemic situation, as happened in the rest of Europe. Even though it is difficult to know what consequences this situation may have in the respiratory pathology of pigs, due to the low pathogenicity of this virus, it has to be taken into account as a part of the etiology of the swine respiratory complex. Also, despite the inconsistent cross-protection provided by PRCV on TGEV infection, this pandemic PRCV situation has occurred concurrently with a sharp decrease in the number of clinical TGE outbreaks in Europe.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Introduction\\n\\nThe intestinal tract, lined by replicating epithelial cells, bathed in nutrient fluids and maintained at optimal temperature provides an ideal milieu for growth of many viruses. 'Enteric viruses' represent a wide spectrum of viral genera that invade and replicate in the mucosa of the intestinal tract, and that can be grouped as follows:. viruses causing localized inflammation at any level of the intestinal tract, predominantly in small intestinal mucosa, resulting in acute gastroenteritis, for example, rotaviruses, caliciviruses, adenoviruses, astroviruses; . viruses that multiply at any level of the intestinal tract, causing few enteric symptoms prior to producing clinical disease at a distant site, for example, measles virus, reoviruses (in mice) , enteroviruses (including polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, enteroviruses, hepatitis A and E); and . viruses that spread to the intestinal tract during the later stages of systemic disease, generally in an immunocompromised host, for example, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cytomegalovirus.This article focuses upon the first category of viruses that cause enteric disease associated with primary replication in the intestinal tract.In the 1950s, the use of monkey kidney cell cultures for the growth of poliovirus revealed the presence of simian viruses and further study showed some of these to have properties consistent with enteroviruses. In parallel, investigations of viruses infecting domestic animals also revealed the presence of enteroviruses (and enteroviruslike particles) in pigs and cattle. Enteroviruses have since been isolated from African buffalo, water buffalo, sheep, goat, deer, and impala and many have been shown to be related to bovine enterovirus isolates.In the past, the classification of enteroviruses was primarily based upon the physico-chemical properties of virions, growth in tissue-cultured cell lines, and by serotyping. In practice, this can be difficult with some isolates being poorly recognized by the reference antisera, or, the occurrence of (misleading) cross-reactivities between serotypes. The expansion of the sequence database together with more sensitive cloning/sequencing techniques have facilitated the elucidation of the genome structures of many picornaviruses. Such analyses have replaced other techniques in the classification of picornaviruses, and this article discusses characteristics which are important for the classification of animal enteroviruses.\\n\\nViruses Associated with Acute Gastroenteritis\\n\\nAcute gastroenteritis is one of the most common health problems worldwide. More than 700 million cases are estimated to occur annually in children less than 5 years of age, resulting in few deaths in developed countries, but more than 2 million deaths in developing countries.Worldwide, a diverse group of viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens cause acute enteric symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, and acute diarrhea. Infections with viral agents, unlike those with bacterial or parasitic pathogens, cannot be treated with antibiotics, and many cannot be prevented by improvements in quality of drinking water, food, or sanitation.Until the early 1970s most viral agents causing gastroenteritis in humans were largely unknown. Studies using electron microscopy of intestinal contents resulted in the discovery of numerous viral enteropathogens now classified as caliciviruses, rotaviruses, astroviruses, or 'enteric' adenoviruses. Caliciviruses are now recognized as the most important cause worldwide of outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis in humans of all age groups. Rotaviruses are the single most important cause of life-threatening diarrhea in children <5 years old. Astroviruses and adenoviruses also cause severe diarrhea in children. Table 1 lists the characteristics of the major viruses associated with acute gastroenteritis. Other viruses linked to gastroenteritis in humans include coronaviruses, toroviruses, picornaviruses, and picobirnaviruses. Understanding many features of these 'enteric viruses' has been based on parallel studies of related viruses infecting animals.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nThe family Caliciviridae contain small RNA viruses that cause enteric disease in a wide variety of hosts including cattle, pigs, rabbits, and humans. Infections in other hosts, for example, sea lions, cats, and primates, appear to cause predominantly systemic and respiratory symptoms. Caliciviruses are small nonenveloped viruses of 27-35 nm diameter ( Figure 1) with a genome comprising a single-stranded positive-sense polyadenylated RNA genome of 7400-7700 nucleotides (nt). Typical calicivirus particles show cup-like hollows (calices) on the virus surface. Some caliciviruses have an indistinct appearance described as 'feathery'.The 'Norwalk agent' (now classified as a calicivirus) was identified in 1972 by Kapikian and colleagues, using immune-electron microscopy (IEM) to search for the causative agent of an 1968 outbreak of gastroenteritis in humans in Norwalk, Ohio, USA. Many related viruses have been implicated as causes of gastroenteritis, and given names identifying the geographical location of the outbreak (e.g., Marin County, Snow Mountain, Hawaii, Sapporo).Virus particles, later classified in the genus Rotavirus, were first described in 1963 by Adams and Kraft as a cause of epidemic diarrhea in infant mice (EDIM). Similar particles (NCDV) were recognized in 1969 by Mebus and colleagues as a cause of severe diarrhea in newborn calves in Nebraska, USA. Neither virus was considered relevant as a causative agent of severe diarrhea in young children until 1973 when Bishop, Davidson, Holmes, and Ruck described a 'new virus' (later shown to be antigenically related to EDIM and NCDV) in duodenal biopsies and diarrheal feces from young children admitted to hospital in Melbourne, Australia with severe acute diarrhea. Named because of their wheel-like appearance in negatively stained extracts examined by electron microscopy (rota \\u00bc Latin for wheel) rotaviruses have since become established as causes of severe acute diarrhea in the young of many mammalian and avian species worldwide. Rotavirus enteritis affects all children regardless of socioeconomic status, and results in over 600 000 deaths annually in young children in developing countries.\\n\\nClassification\\n\\nClassification of caliciviruses was hampered for many years by the inability to culture these viruses, and study their genetic and protein structure. Caliciviruses causing enteric infections (in humans and other animals) are classified as belonging to the family Caliciviridae, which is divided into four genera. The genus Norovirus (NoV), and genus Sapovirus (SaV) cause human and animal infections. Other genera infect rabbits (Lagovirus) or sealions, cats, and primates (Vesivirus). The genome organization and reading frame usage differs between the four genera. For noroviruses, the genome contains three open reading frames (ORFs). The largest (ORF1) encodes a polyprotein which undergoes proteolytic cleavage to produce an NTPase, a 3c-like protease, and an RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). ORF2 encodes the major capsid protein and ORF3 a putative minor capsid protein.Noroviruses are subdivided into five genogroups (GI-GV). Genogroups GI, GII, and GIV infect humans, GIII infects cattle and GV infects mice. GI and GII contain at least 10 and 20 distinct genetic clusters, respectively. Sapoviruses are divided into genogroups (GI-GV), of which GI, GII, GIV, and GV infect humans. GI and GII are further divided into four and three genetic clusters.The inability to culture human caliciviruses delayed the introduction of diagnostic tests, resulting in an under-appreciation of the significance of these agents for many years. Currently, over 20 different reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays targeting regions on the RdRp gene and the capsid gene have been described and utilized in epidemiological studies. This large genetic diversity of human caliciviruses makes routine detection difficult.Rotaviruses are nonenveloped icosahedral viruses of 70 nm ( Figure 2 ) diameter that belong to the genus Rotavirus within the family Reoviridae. The double-stranded RNA genome is contained within a triple-layer of viral proteins (VPs) comprising a core (VP1, VP2, VP3), an inner capsid (VP6), and an outer capsid (VP4, VP7). Rotaviruses are classified into groups A to G based on serology of the VP6 protein. The majority of human and mammalian infections, due to group A viruses, are further classified into serotypes by antigenic differences on VP7 (G-serotypes) and into genotypes by genetic differences on VP4 (P-genotypes). To date there are at least 11 of 15 G-serotypes and 15 of 26 P-genotypes identified in humans. Groups B and C have been identified infrequently in humans. Groups D to G have been identified only in nonhuman mammalian or avian species. \\n\\nGeographic and Seasonal Distribution\\n\\nHuman NoV are the leading causes of 'nonbacterial gastroenteritis' outbreaks in all age groups worldwide. Outbreaks frequently occur in communities such as nursing homes, hospitals, schools, and cruise ships. No consistent seasonal variation has been observed. Infection involves transmission via person-to-person contact or ingestion of contaminated food and water. Epidemiological studies have identified caliciviruses in 60-95% of outbreaks in many countries. Estimates of disease burden in USA suggest that caliciviruses are responsible annually for 23 million illnesses and 50 000 hospitalizations. Strains of NoV GII cluster 4 (GII-4) have been the most common type identified worldwide in the past 5 years (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) in both adults and children. Prevalence rates of calicivirus (predominantly NoV) in young children admitted to hospital with acute gastroenteritis in many countries range from 3.5% to 20% annually. Strains of SaV, while playing a minor role overall, are more generally associated with childhood gastroenteritis than with disease in older children and adults. Caliciviruses may be important enteric pathogens in patients with hereditary or acquired immunodeficiency.EAd40 and EAd41 occur worldwide, causing severe acute enteritis in 5-15% of hospitalized young children. Outbreaks occur at unpredictable intervals year-round with no seasonal prevalence. Nosocomial epidemics occur in day-care nurseries and in hospital wards for children and adults. Group A adenoviruses (serotypes 12, 18, 31) have also been implicated in epidemics, usually in older age groups.\\n\\nGenetics\\n\\nThe genera Norovirus and Sapovirus are genetically diverse, and multiple strains co-circulate in human populations. Individual dominant strains emerge every 2-5 years, and often have a global impact, such as the GII-4 strains identified in USA, Europe, Japan, and Australia in 1995/ 1996 and again in 2004. NoV recombinant strains, with polymerase and capsid genes derived from different ancestral clusters, have been identified in Thailand and Australia. Repeated attempts to adapt NoV and SaV to growth in cell culture have failed. Diagnostic techniques and analysis of antigenic variation rely predominantly on molecular biological techniques. Cloning and expression of the major viral capsid protein (VP1) in baculovirus expression systems has led to the formation of virus-like particles (VLPs) morphologically similar to native virus and their incorporation into enzyme immunoassay (EIA) assays.The rotavirus genome consists of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA that can be separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, allowing epidemiological studies mapping the genetic diversity of strains within and between serotypes. Each gene segment encodes a separate protein, with the exception of gene segment 11 which encodes two proteins. Reassortment of genes between human strains and human and animal strains occurs in vivo and in vitro.\\n\\nPathogenesis\\n\\nPathogenesis of NoV and SaV infection is poorly understood as a result of the long-standing inability to adapt these viruses to cell culture, and the absence of a small animal model. Symptomatic enteritis in human volunteers infected with 'Norwalk agent' showed changes in jejunal biopsies (mucosal inflammation, absorptive cell abnormalities, villus shortening, and crypt hypertrophy) that persisted for at least 4 days after remission of clinical symptoms and reverted to normal after 2 weeks. No identifiable viral particles were detected by electron microscopy in any affected intestinal tissue. The recent demonstration that human noroviruses can infect and replicate in a three-dimensional cell culture model of human intestinal epithelium, should improve our understanding of the pathogenesis, and antigenic diversity of this important group of enteric viruses. These studies will also be enhanced by discovery of a norovirus that infects mice, and that replicates after transfection of cultured kidney cells.Rotaviruses are transmitted from person to person by the fecal-oral route, or via aerosols. Rotaviruses replicate in the cytoplasm of mature nonreplicating enterocytes lining the upper portions of the small intestinal villi, eventually causing cytolysis. Profuse watery diarrhea results from a combination of mechanisms including malabsorption secondary to loss of enterocytes responsible for absorption and digestion, activation of the enteric nervous system, and stimulation of intestinal secretion by the rotavirus nonstructural protein NSP4. Rotavirus antigenemia and viremia occur during the acute phase of severe primary rotavirus disease. As a result, complete rotavirus particles have been found in liver, lung, spleen, pancreas, thymus, and kidneys of experimental animals. It is not clear if the virus is replicating at these sites.EAd replicate within the epithelial cells of the small intestine. Group A adenoviruses have also been grown from mesenteric lymph nodes and appendices. The mechanisms causing diarrhea are not clear, but destruction of infected epithelial cells has a role.Acute astrovirus infection induces a mild watery diarrhea in young children that lasts for 2-3 days and may be associated with vomiting, fever, and anorexia. The lack of a small animal model has hampered studies of the mechanism of astrovirus-induced diarrhea. Experimental models of astrovirus enteritis in turkeys and in gnotobiotic lambs show mild histopathological changes in the intestine (despite high mortality from severe osmotic diarrhea) together with viremia. Experimental astrovirus infection in calves is asymptomatic, with viral replication apparently targeted to M cells. It is possible that none of these animal models illuminate pathogenesis of HAstV infection in humans. Cultivation of HAstV was initially difficult, but can now regularly be achieved using a human colon cancer derived epithelial cell line (CaCo2 cells). \\n\\nImmune Responses, Prevention and Control\\n\\nMechanisms of immunity to NoV are unclear. Infection results in formation of IgG and IgM serum antibody that are broadly reactive within, but not between, genogroups. The role of these antibodies in immune protection is unknown. Infected individuals can develop short-term immunity to homologous viruses but the molecular diversity of NoV circulating in communities makes it difficult to predict whether long-term immunity can develop. It is unclear why a proportion of exposed individuals remain uninfected during outbreaks. Recent studies suggest that histo-blood group antigens and the secretor status may be genetic susceptibility markers for infection. At present the major control strategies for prevention of human calicivirus infection rely on prevention of contamination of food and water supplies.\\n\\nHost Range\\n\\nGroup A rotaviruses infect humans and other mammals repeatedly throughout life. Most primary rotavirus infections in animals occur during the neonatal period. Most primary rotavirus infections in humans occur during the first 24 months of life. Children worldwide will experience at least one rotavirus infection by 5 years of age.In general, group A rotaviruses are species specific. However, rotavirus strains with gene segments of feline, bovine, or porcine origin have been isolated from children, suggesting the occurrence of cross-species infection in nature. Cross-species infections can be established experimentally, and comprise one of the strategies for human vaccine development.\\n\\nClinical Features\\n\\nClinical symptoms in children are strongly influenced by age, with severe often life-threatening diarrhea occurring after primary infection in young children, and in aged people in nursing homes. Excretion of rotavirus particles in detectable numbers (by EIA, RT/PCR) continues for 5-10 days, and occasionally up to 50 days. Excretion can continue for months in immunodeficient children and animals. Reinfections occur throughout life, and are usually asymptomatic or associated with mild symptoms. Symptoms of primary infection require medical attention in 1:5 children, result in hospitalization in 1:65 children and death in 1:293 (almost all in young children in developing countries). Treatment is based upon replacement of fluid and electrolyte loss, usually achieved by oral administration of fluids containing glucose and electrolytes. Occasionally, delayed repair of the small intestinal mucosa is associated with disaccharide or monosaccharide malabsorption leading to malnutrition.Adenovirus diarrhea is more common in infants <12 months old than in older children, and can be protracted with a mean duration of 12 days. Adenovirus diarrhea occurs in immunocompromised patients. Nonseasonal epidemics of EAd diarrhea occur in hospital wards, orphanages, and day-care nurseries. Occasional fatal cases have been reported in children. Evidence from animal models (with non-EAd) suggests that viremia occurs, and can lead to infection of other tissues. The natural history of disease and development of immunity is unknown.\\n\\nImmune Response/Prevention and Control\\n\\nPrimary rotavirus infection protects against severe symptomatic disease on reinfection, and is associated with humoral and cellular immune responses to individual rotavirus proteins. Neutralizing antibody to VP4 and VP7 outer capsid proteins contribute to protection, possibly by interfering with viral replication and limiting the extent of intestinal damage. The role of immune responses to other proteins is uncertain. Virus-specific cytotoxic Tcells are not essential for protection.The importance of rotavirus disease worldwide and its contribution to childhood mortality in developing countries has resulted in strong initiatives, supported by the World Health Organization, to develop live oral rotavirus vaccines to be administered to infants before 3 months of age. Two contrasting vaccines, a single attenuated G1P[8] human rotavirus and a pentavalent human-bovine G1-G4,P[8] reassortant vaccine, have been proved to be safe and effective in preventing severe rotavirus disease. Both have the potential to radically change global childhood mortality and morbidity.\\n\\nHistory and Classification\\n\\nAdenoviruses were first detected in 1953 in cultured fragments of tonsillar and adenoidal tissue from children. They are nonenveloped icosahedral viruses approximately 80 nm in diameter (Figure 3) . The genome is composed of double-stranded DNA. The family Adenoviridae comprises three genera: Mastadenovirus (mammalian) classified into subgenera A-F representing more than 50 serotypes, Aviadenovirus (birds), and a newly recognized genus Atadenovirus identified in sheep and reptiles. Most are readily cultivatable. Adenovirus infections occur worldwide in many mammalian species, are species specific, usually associated with disease in the respiratory, urinary, and ocular systems, and are frequently shed in feces in the absence of any gastrointestinal symptoms.In 1975, Flewett and colleagues in Birmingham, UK, noticed the presence of large numbers of adenovirus particles in negatively stained extracts of diarrheal stools examined by EM. These proved difficult to culture, were designated 'enteric' adenoviruses (EAd), and are now classified as serotypes EAd40 and EAd41 within subgenus group F. Cultivation of EAd remains difficult. The most reliable growth has been achieved in human embryonic kidney cells (293 cells) immortalized by transfection with regions of Ad5.Astroviruses were first described in the UK in 1975 by Madeley and Cosgrove studying an outbreak of diarrhea in newborn babies in an obstetric hospital nursery. Astroviruses are small, round nonenveloped plus-stranded RNA viruses 28-30 nm diameter (Figure 4) occasionally exhibiting virions with a superficial star shape. They are members of the genus Astrovirus in the family Astroviridae. They have been detected in humans (children and adults) and a range of mammalian (sheep, cattle, pigs, dogs, cats, and mice) and avian (turkeys, ducks) species, usually associated with diarrhea. There are currently eight serotypes of human astrovirus, designated HAstV 1-8, based on reactivity with polyclonal antisera. HAstV 1 is most common worldwide.Prevalence rates as a cause of diarrhea vary from 2% to 16% (hospital-based studies), and 5% to 17% (community-based studies). Most astrovirus infections have been recorded during colder months in temperate climates and year-round in tropical countries. A longitudinal study in Mayan children in a poor community in Mexico found a high prevalence (61%) of astrovirus infection in a birth cohort of 271 children followed for 3 years. Infection occurred primarily in infants <12 months old, and showed a high rate of asymptomatic infection and prolonged shedding (2-17 weeks) in many infants. Astrovirus infection has also been associated with persistent diarrhea (lasting for 14 days or more) in children in Bangladesh. Astroviruses are widespread in developed countries, causing outbreaks in day-care centers, hospitals, and nursing homes for the elderly. They are an important cause of enteritis in immunocompromised patients.\\n\\nGenetics/Evolution\\n\\nThe adenovirus virion is composed of at least 10 different structural polypeptides and contains a linear 33-45 kbp DNA. Virus capsomers are arranged as hexons, the corners of which have antenna-like (fiber) projections presumed involved in cell attachment. The DNA genomes of groups A-F are genetically diverse, and differences can be illustrated by analysis using genome restriction endonucleases. The heterogenous genome in groups A-F makes recombination between subgenera unlikely, with exception of groups A and F which show a close evolutionary relationship.Diagnoses of EAd infection rely on EIA that detects the hexon antigen common to groups A-F, followed by determination of restriction enzyme patterns and/or reactions in EIA incorporating neutralizing, monoclonal antibodies specific for Ed40 and 41. \\n\\nGenetics and Evolution\\n\\nThe HAst genome is a polyadenylated plus-stranded RNA molecule of approximately 7 kbp. The genome contains two open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and -1b, code for nonstructural proteins and ORF2 encodes for the capsid protein. Genetic diversity in all serotypes exists, but no association has been shown between serotypes and ability to cause severe gastroenteritis. Astrovirus diagnostic assays include commercially available EIA kits, electron microscopy and RT-PCR detection and genotyping of diarrheal feces.\\n\\nCoronaviruses/Toroviruses\\n\\nMembers of the genera Coronavirus and Torovirus are enveloped plus-strand single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae. Electron microscopy shows them to be pleomorphic fringed particles 100-140 nm at maximum dimension ( Figure 5 ). Coronaviruses and toroviruses can be distinguished by differences in peplomer structure and reaction in IEM using specific antisera.Coronaviruses and toroviruses cause diarrhea, respiratory, and/or hepatic disease in many animal species, including cattle, mice, swine, cats, and dogs. In general, most of these viruses are species specific and disease is most severe in infant animals. Transmission is fecal-oral and due to virus lability may require close contact. Coronaviruses and toroviruses have been implicated in human diarrheal disease but there is still no consensus about their importance. Similar particles have been seen frequently in children without diarrhea, particularly in children in developing countries. Morphological similarities between these viruses and fragments of intestinal brush border make diagnosis difficult. Several studies have implicated coronaviruses as causative agents of necrotizing enterocolitis outbreaks in newborn babies.Toroviruses were first described as a cause of diarrhea by Woode and colleagues in 1979 when Breda virus was identified in a severe outbreak of neonatal calf diarrhea in USA. Toroviruses are now also known to infect horses (Berne virus) and swine. Human infections were first described by Flewett et al. in Birmingham UK in 1984, but have rarely been reported since then.The pathogenesis of diarrhea has been studied in animal models using infection with coronavirus (TGE) in piglets, and with Breda viruses in calves. Both replicate in epithelial cells of small intestine and descending colon causing diarrhea 24-72 h later. Breda virus also replicates in crypt cells.Many animal coronaviruses can be propagated in cell culture. Isolation of human enteric coronaviruses is difficult and serological studies can be confounded by antibody resulting from repeated respiratory coronavirus infection. Enteric infection can be confirmed in feces by detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR, or IEM using antibodies to the viral envelope glycoproteins.\\n\\nPicornaviruses\\n\\nPicornaviruses are 24-30 nm featureless spherical particles containing single-stranded positive-sense RNA. They have been found in diarrheal feces from humans but their etiological role is often not clear. The first clear evidence implicating a picornavirus as an enteric pathogen identified Aichi virus, as a cause of oyster-associated epidemics of gastroenteritis in Japan in 1989. Aichi viruses are now classified as a new genus Kobuvirus within the family Picornaviridae (kobu \\u00bc Japanese for knob). Isolation of Aichi virus in Vero cells has permitted development of EIA and RT-PCR assays based on nucleotide sequence data. Serological assays show seroconversion resulting from infection and a prevalence rate for antibody of 7.2% in Japanese children aged 7 months to 4 years and rising to 80% in adults by age 35.The new genus Parechovirus within the family Picornavirideae contains at least one serotype (previously echovirus 22) that has been implicated as an enteric pathogen in humans.\\n\\nParvoviruses\\n\\nParvoviruses are small 22-26 nm single-stranded DNA viruses comprising a genus Parvovirus in the family Parvoviridae. Some animal parvoviruses have been clearly linked to enteritis including bovine, feline, mink, and canine strains. Canine parvovirus infection emerged after 1977. This lethal neonatal enteric infection, accompanied by viremia and widespread systemic infection, shows a pathogenesis distinct from most enteropathogenic viruses. The virus infects and destroys crypt epithelial cells resulting in flat mucosa with fused and stunted villi. Damage has been likened to that caused by radiation.Other small viruses, resembling parvoviruses, have been seen by EM in diarrheal feces in humans. Evidence linking them to causation of disease is not convincing. They have often been present as dual infections with known enteric pathogens. In addition, their resemblance to some phages makes diagnosis uncertain. \\n\\nBovine Enteroviruses\\n\\nBovine enteroviruses (BEVs) are endemic in cattle in many regions of the world with infection typically Enteroviruses of Animals\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bibliography\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Electron microscopic studies of bovine viral diarrhoea virus in tissues of diseased calves and in cell cultures, H Bielefeldt-Ohmann, B Bloch, Archives of Virology, 1982; Application of stereological methods to cytophysiologic experiments on polarised cells, P H Burri, H Giger, H R Gnagi, E R Weibel, D Chasey, Alexander , D J , Proceedings of 4th European Conference for Electron Microscopy (Rome), 1968; Cytopathology in viral diseases, N F Cheville, Coronaviruses.

Novel mammalian coronaviruses are now regularly identified. 1 For example, an HKU2related coronavirus of bat origin was responsible for a fatal acute diarrhoea syndrome in pigs in 2018. 4 for 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection and 858 fatalities since September, 2012, including 38 deaths following a single introduction into South Korea. 8, 9 In late December, 2019, several patients with viral pneumonia were found to be epidemiologically associated with the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China, where a number of non-aquatic animals such as birds and rabbits were also on sale before the outbreak. A novel, human-infecting coronavirus, 10, 11 provisionally named 2019 novel corona virus (2019-nCoV), was identified with use of next-generation sequencing. As of Jan 28, 2020, China has reported more than 5900 confirmed and more than 9000 suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infection across 33 Chinese provinces or municipalities, with 106 fatalities. In addition, 2019-nCoV has now been reported in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and the USA. Infections in medical workers and family clusters were also reported and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. 12 Most of the infected patients had a high fever and some had dyspnoea, with chest radiographs revealing invasive lesions in both lungs. 12, 13 We report the epidemiological data of nine inpatients, from at least three hospitals in Wuhan, who were diagnosed with viral pneumonia of unidentified cause. Using next-generation sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples and cultured isolates from these patients, 2019-nCoV was found. We describe the genomic characterisation of ten genomes of this novel virus, providing important information on the origins and cell receptor binding of the virus.\\n\\nPatients and samples\\n\\nNine patients with viral pneumonia and negative for common respiratory pathogens, who presented to at least three hospitals in Wuhan, were included in this study. Eight of the patients had visited the Huanan seafood market before the onset of illness, and one patient (WH04) did not visit the market but stayed in a hotel near the market between Dec 23 and Dec 27, 2019 (table) . Five of the patients (WH19001, WH19002, WH19004, WH19008, and YS8011) had samples collected by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which were tested for 18 viruses and four bacteria using the RespiFinderSmart22 Kit (PathoFinder, Maastricht, Netherlands) on the LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR system (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Presence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was tested using a previously reported method. 14 All five CDC samples were negative for all common respiratory pathogens screened for. Four of the patients (WH01, WH02, WH03, and WH04) had samples collected by BGI (Beijing, China), and were tested for five viruses and one bacterium using the RespiPathogen 6 Kit (Jiangsu Macro & Micro Test, Nantong, China) on the Applied Biosystems ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR system (ThermoFisher Scientific, Foster City, CA, USA). All four samples were negative for the targeted respiratory pathogens.\\n\\nVirus isolation\\n\\nSpecial-pathogen-free human airway epithelial (HAE) cells were used for virus isolation. Briefly, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids or throat swabs from the patients were inoculated into the HAE cells through the apical surfaces. HAE cells were maintained in an air-liquid interface incubated at 37\\u00b0C. The cells were monitored daily for cytopathic effects by light microscopy and the cell supernatants were collected for use in quantitative RT-PCR assays. After three passages, apical samples were collected for sequencing.\\n\\nResearch in context\\n\\nEvidence before this study The causal agent of an outbreak of severe pneumonia in Wuhan, China, is a novel coronavirus, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The first cases were reported in December, 2019.\\n\\nAdded value of this study\\n\\nWe have described the genomic characteristics of 2019-nCoV and similarities and differences to other coronaviruses, including the virus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic of 2002-03. Genome sequences of 2019-nCoV sampled from nine patients who were among the early cases of this severe infection are almost genetically identical, which suggests very recent emergence of this virus in humans and that the outbreak was detected relatively rapidly. 2019-nCoV is most closely related to other betacoronaviruses of bat origin, indicating that these animals are the likely reservoir hosts for this emerging viral pathogen.\\n\\nImplications of all the available evidence\\n\\nBy documenting the presence of 2019-nCoV in a sample of patients, our study extends previous evidence that this virus has led to the novel pneumonia that has caused severe disease in Wuhan and other geographical localities. Currently available data suggest that 2019-nCoV infected the human population from a bat reservoir, although it remains unclear if a currently unknown animal species acted as an intermediate host between bats and humans.reverse-transcribed into cDNA, followed by the secondstrand synthesis. Using the synthetic double-stranded DNA, a DNA library was constructed through DNAfragmentation, end-repair, adaptor-ligation, and PCR amplification. The constructed library was qualified with an Invitrogen Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher, Foster City, CA, USA), and the qualified double-stranded DNA library was transformed into a single-stranded circular DNA library through DNA-denaturation and circularisation. DNA nanoballs were generated from singlestranded circular DNA by rolling circle amplification, then qualified with Qubit 2.0 and loaded onto the flow cell and sequenced with PE100 on the DNBSEQ-T7 platform (MGI, Shenzhen, China).After removing adapter, low-quality, and low-complexity reads, high-quality genome sequencing data were generated. Sequence reads were first filtered against the human reference genome (hg19) using Burrows-Wheeler Alignment. 15 The remaining data were then aligned to the local nucleotide database (using Burrows-Wheeler Alignment) and non-redundant protein database (using RapSearch), 16 downloaded from the US National Center for Biotechnology Information website, which contain only coronaviruses that have been published. Finally, the mapped reads were assembled with SPAdes 17 to obtain a high-quality coronavirus genome sequence.Primers were designed with use of OLIGO Primer Analysis Software version 6.44 on the basis of the assembled partial genome, and were verified by Primer-Blast (for more details on primer sequencs used please contact the corresponding author). PCR was set up as follows: 4\\u00b75 \\u03bcL of 10X buffer, 4 \\u03bcL of dNTP mix (2\\u00b75 \\u03bcmol/L), 1 \\u03bcL of each primer (10 \\u03bcmol/L), and 0\\u00b775 units of HS Ex Taq (Takara Biomedical Technology, Beijing, China), in a total volume of 30 \\u03bcL. The cDNAs reverse transcribed from clinical samples were used as templates, and random primers were used. The following program was run on the thermocycler: 95\\u00b0C for 5 min; 40 cycles of 95\\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\\u00b0C for 1 min as determined by product size; 72\\u00b0C for 7 min; and a 4\\u00b0C hold. Finally, the PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and products of the expected size were sequenced from both ends on the Applied Biosystems 3730 DNA Analyzer platform (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA; for more details on expected size please contact the corresponding author).\\n\\nChinese CDC sequencing strategy\\n\\nThe whole-genome sequences of 2019-nCoV from six samples (WH19001, WH19005, WH19002, WH19004, WH19008, and YS8011) were generated by a combination Sanger, Illumina, and Oxford nanopore sequencing. First, viral RNAs were extracted directly from clinical samples with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, and then used to synthesise cDNA with the SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and N6 random primers, followed by second-strand synthesis with DNA Polymerase I, Large (Klenow) Fragment (ThermoFisher). Viral cDNA libraries were prepared with use of the Nextera XT Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), then purified with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), followed by quantification with an Invitrogen Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. The resulting DNA libraries were sequenced on either the MiSeq or iSeq platforms (Illumina) using a 300-cycle reagent kit. About 1\\u00b72-5 GB of data were obtained for each sample.The raw fastQ files for each virus sample were filtered using previously described criteria, 18 then subjected to de novo assembly with the CLCBio software version 11.0.1. Mapped assemblies were also done using the batderived SARS-like coronavirus isolate bat-SL-CoVZC45 (accession number MG772933.1) as a reference. Variant calling, genome alignments, and sequence illustrations were generated with CLCBio software, and the assembled genome sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was done to obtain the sequences of the 5\\u02b9 and 3\\u02b9 termini, using the Invitrogen 5\\u02b9 RACE System and 3\\u02b9 RACE System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene-specific primers (appendix p 1) for 5\\u02b9 and 3\\u02b9 RACE PCR amplification were designed to obtain a fragment of approximately 400-500 bp for the two regions. Purified PCR products were cloned into the pMD18-T Simple Vector (TaKaRa, Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China) and chemically com petent Escherichia coli (DH5\\u03b1 cells; TaKaRa), according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were sequenced with use of M13 forward and reverse primers.\\n\\nVirus genome analysis and annotation\\n\\nReference virus genomes were obtained from GenBank using Blastn with 2019-nCoV as a query. The open reading frames of the verified genome sequences were predicted using Geneious (version 11.1.5) and annotated using the Conserved Domain Database. 19 Pairwise sequence identities were also calculated using Geneious. Potential genetic recombination was investigated using SimPlot software (version 3.5.1) 20 and phylogenetic analysis.\\n\\nPhylogenetic analysis\\n\\nSequence alignment of 2019-nCoV with reference sequences was done with Mafft software (version 7.450). 21 Phylogenetic analyses of the complete genome and major coding regions were done with RAxML software (version 8.2.9) 22 with 1000 bootstrap replicates, employing the general time reversible nucleotide substitution model.\\n\\nDevelopment of molecular diagnostics for 2019-nCoV\\n\\nOn the basis of the genome sequences obtained, a real-time PCR detection assay was developed. PCR primers and probes were designed using Applied Biosystems Primer Express Software (ThermoFisher Scientific, Foster City, CA, USA) on the basis of our sequenced virus genomes. The specific primers and probe set (labelled with the reporter 6-carboxyfluorescein [FAM] and the quencher Black Hole Quencher 1 [BHQ1]) for orf1a were as follows: for ward primer 5\\u02b9-AGAAGATTGGTTAGATGATGATAGT-3\\u02b9; re verse pri mer 5\\u02b9-TTCCATCTCTAATTGAGGTTGAACC-3\\u02b9; and probe 5\\u02b9-FAM-TCCTCACTGCCGTCTTGTTG ACCA-BHQ1-3\\u02b9. The human GAPDH gene was used as an internal con trol (forward primer 5\\u02b9-TCAAGAA GGTGGTGAAGCAGG-3\\u02b9; reverse primer 5\\u02b9-CAGCGTC AAA GGTG GAGGAGT-3\\u02b9; probe 5\\u02b9-VIC-CCT CAA GGG CATCC TGGG CTACACT-BHQ1-3\\u02b9). Primers and probes were synthesised by BGI (Beijing, China). RT-PCR was done with an Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo-Scientific), with 30 \\u00b5L reaction volumes consisting of 14 \\u00b5L of diluted RNA, 15 \\u00b5L of 2X Taqman One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix Reagents (4309169; Applied Biosystems, ThermoFisher), 0\\u00b75 \\u00b5L of 40X MultiScribe and RNase inhibitor mixture, 0\\u00b775 \\u03bcL forward primer (10 \\u03bcmol/L), 0\\u00b775 \\u03bcL reverse primer (10 \\u03bcmol/L), and 0\\u00b7375 \\u03bcL probe (10 \\u03bcmol/L). Thermal cycling parameters were 30 min at 42\\u00b0C, followed by 10 min at 95\\u00b0C, and a subsequent 40 cycles of amplification (95\\u00b0C for 15 s and 58\\u00b0C for 45 s). Fluorescence was recorded during the 58\\u00b0C phase.\\n\\nRole of the funding source\\n\\nThe funder of the study had no role in data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of report. GFG and WS had access to all the data in the study, and GFG, WS, WT, WC, and GW were responsible for the decision to submit for publication.\\n\\nResults\\n\\nFrom the nine patients' samples analysed, eight complete and two partial genome sequences of 2019-nCoV were obtained. These data have been deposited in the China National Microbiological Data Center (accession number NMDC10013002 and genome accession numbers NMDC60013002-01 to NMDC60013002-10) and the data from BGI have been deposited in the China National GeneBank (acces sion numbers CNA0007332-35).Based on these genomes, we developed a real-time PCR assay and tested the original clinical samples from the BGI (WH01, WH02, WH03, and WH04) again to determine their threshold cycle (Ct) values (table) . The remaining samples were tested by a different real-time PCR assay developed by the Chinese CDC, with Ct values ranging from 22\\u00b785 to 32\\u00b741 (table) . These results confirmed the presence of 2019-nCoV in the patients. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples or cultured viruses of nine patients were used for next-generation sequencing. After removing host (human) reads, de novo assembly was done and the contigs obtained used as queries to search the non-redundant protein database. Some contigs identified in all the samples were closely related to the bat SARS-like betacoronavirus bat-SL-CoVZC45 betacoronavirus. 23 Bat-SL-CoVZC45 was then used as the reference genome and reads from each pool were mapped to it, generating consensus sequences corresponding to all the pools. These consensus sequences were then used as new reference genomes. Eight complete genomes and two partial genomes (from samples WH19002 and WH02; table) were obtained. The de novo assembly of the clean reads from all the pools did not identify any other long contigs that corresponded to other viruses at high abundance.The eight complete genomes were nearly identical across the whole genome, with sequence identity above 99\\u00b798%, indicative of a very recent emergence into the human population ( figure 1A) . The largest nucleotide difference was four mutations. Notably, the sequence identity between the two virus genomes from the same patient (WH19001, from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and WH19005, from cell culture) was more than 99\\u00b799%, 3'\\n\\n3'\\n\\n3'3' Base pairs with 100% identity at the amino acid level. In addition, the partial genomes from samples WH02 and WH19002 also had nearly 100% identity to the complete genomes across the aligned gene regions. A Blastn search of the complete genomes of 2019-nCoV revealed that the most closely related viruses available on GenBank were bat-SL-CoVZC45 (sequence identity 87\\u00b799%; query coverage 99%) and another SARS-like betacoronavirus of bat origin, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (accession number MG772934; 23 87\\u00b723%; query coverage 98%). In five gene regions (E, M, 7, N, and 14) , the sequence identities were greater than 90%, with the highest being 98\\u00b77% in the E gene ( figure 2A) . The S gene of 2019-nCoV exhibited the lowest sequence identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, at only around 75%. In addition, the sequence identity in 1b (about 86%) was lower than that in 1a (about 90%; figure 2A) . Most of the encoded proteins exhibited high sequence identity between 2019-nCoV and the related bat-derived coronaviruses ( figure 2a) . The notable exception was the spike protein, with only around 80% sequence identity, and protein 13, with 73\\u00b72% sequence identity. Notably, the 2019-nCoV strains were less genetically similar to SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). The similarity between 2019-nCoV and related viruses was visualised using SimPlot software, with the 2019-nCoV consensus sequence employed as the query ( figure 2B) .Comparison of the predicted coding regions of 2019-nCoV showed that they possessed a similar genomic organisation to bat-SL-CoVZC45, bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and SARS-CoV Phylogenetic analysis of 2019-nCoV and its closely related reference genomes, as well as representative betacoronaviruses, revealed that the five subgenera formed five well supported branches ( figure 3) . The subgenus Sarbecovirus could be classified into three well supported clades: two SARS-CoV-related strains from Rhinolophus sp from Bulgaria (accession number GU190215) and Kenya (KY352407) formed clade 1; the ten 2019-nCoV from Wuhan and the two bat-derived SARS-like strains from Zhoushan in eastern China (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21) formed clade 2, which was notable for the long branch separating the human and bat viruses; and SARS-CoV strains from humans and many genetically similar SARS-like corona viruses from bats collected from southwestern China formed clade 3, with bat-derived coronaviruses also falling in the basal positions ( figure 3 ). In addition, 2019-nCoV was distinct from SARS-CoV in a phylogeny of the complete RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene (appendix p 2). This evidence indicates that 2019-nCoV is a novel beta coronavirus from the subgenus Sarbecovirus.As the sequence similarity plot revealed changes in genetic distances among viruses across the 2019-nCoV genome, we did additional phylogenetic analyses of the major encoding regions of representative members of the subgenus Sarbecovirus. Consistent with the genome phylogeny, 2019-nCoV, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 clustered together in trees of the 1a and spike genes (appendix p 3). By contrast, 2019-nCoV did not cluster with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 in the 1b tree, but instead formed a distinct clade with SARS-CoV, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (appendix p 3), indicative of potential recombination events in 1b, although these probably occurred in the bat coronaviruses rather than 2019-nCoV. Phylogenetic analysis of the 2019-nCoV genome excluding 1b revealed similar evolutionary relationships as the full-length viral genome (appendix p 3).The envelope spike (S) protein mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion 24 and is crucial for determining host tropism and transmission capacity. 25, 26 Generally, the spike protein of coronaviruses is functionally divided into the S1 domain (especially positions 318-510 of SARS-CoV), responsible for receptor binding, and the S2 domain, responsible for cell membrane fusion. 27 The 2019-nCoV S2 protein showed around 93% sequence identity with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21-much higher than that of the S1 domain, which had only around 68% identity with these bat-derived viruses. Both the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain of the S1 domain can bind to host receptors. 28 We inspected amino acid variation in the spike protein among the Sarbecovirus coronaviruses The receptor-binding domain of betacoronaviruses, which directly engages the receptor, is commonly located in the C-terminal domain of S1, as in SARS-CoV 29 for lineage B, and MERS-CoV 30,31 and BatCoV HKU4, 32 for lineage C (figure 5). Through phylogenetic analysis of the receptor-binding domain of four different lineages of betacoronaviruses (appendix p 4), we found that, although 2019-nCoV was closer to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 at the whole-genome level, the receptor-binding domain of 2019-nCoV fell within lineage B and was closer to that of SARS-CoV (figure 5A). The three-dimensional structure of 2019-nCoV receptorbinding domain was modelled using the Swiss-Model program 33 with the SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain structure (Protein Data Bank ID 2DD8) 34 as a template. This analysis suggested that, like other betacoronaviruses, the receptor-binding domain was composed of a core and an external subdomain ( figure 5B-D) .Notably, the external subdomain of the 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain was more similar to that of SARS-CoV. This result suggests that 2019-nCoV might also use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor. However, we also observed that several key residues responsible for the binding of the SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain to the ACE2 receptor were variable in the 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain (including Asn439, Asn501, Gln493, Gly485 and Phe486; 2019-nCoV numbering).\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nFrom genomic surveillance of clinical samples from patients with viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, a novel coronavirus (termed 2019-nCoV) has been identified. 10, 11 Our phylogenetic analysis of 2019-nCoV, sequenced from nine patients' samples, showed that the virus belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus. 2019-nCoV was more similar to two bat-derived coronavirus strains, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, than to known human-infecting coronaviruses, including the virus that caused the SARS outbreak of 2003.Epidemiologically, eight of the nine patients in our study had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, suggesting that they might have been in close contact with the infection source at the market. However, one patient had never visited the market, although he had stayed in a hotel near the market before the onset of their illness. This finding suggests either possible droplet transmission or that the patient was infected by a currently unknown source. Evidence of clusters of infected family members and medical workers has now confirmed the presence of human-to-human transmission. 12 Clearly, this infection is a major public health concern, particularly as this outbreak coincides with the peak of the Chinese Spring Festival travel rush, during which hundreds of millions of people will travel through China. As a typical RNA virus, the average evolutionary rate for coronaviruses is roughly 10 -\\u2074 nucleotide substitutions per site per year, 1 with mutations arising during every replication cycle. It is, therefore, striking that the sequences of 2019-nCoV from different patients described here were almost identical, with greater than 99\\u00b79% sequence identity. This finding suggests that 2019-nCoV originated from one source within a very short period and was detected relatively rapidly. However, as the virus transmits to more individuals, constant surveillance of mutations arising is needed.\\n\\nSARS-CoV\\n\\nPhylogenetic analysis showed that bat-derived coronaviruses fell within all five subgenera of the genus Betacoronavirus. Moreover, bat-derived coronaviruses fell in basal positions in the subgenus Sarbecovirus, with 2019-nCoV most closely related to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, which were also sampled from bats. 23 These data are consistent with a bat reservoir for coronaviruses in general and for 2019-nCoV in particular. However, despite the importance of bats, several facts suggest that another animal is acting as an intermediate host between bats and humans. First, the outbreak was first reported in late December, 2019, when most bat species in Wuhan are hibernating. Second, no bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market, whereas various non-aquatic animals (including mammals) were available for purchase. Third, the sequence identity between 2019-nCoV and its close relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 was less than 90%, which is reflected in the relatively long branch between them. Hence, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 are not direct ancestors of 2019-nCoV. Fourth, in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, bats acted as the natural reservoir, with another animal (masked palm civet for SARS-CoV 35 and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV) 36 acting as an intermediate host, with humans as terminal hosts. Therefore, on the basis of current data, it seems likely that the 2019-nCoV causing the Wuhan outbreak might also be initially hosted by bats, and might have been transmitted to humans via currently unknown wild animal(s) sold at the Huanan seafood market.Previous studies have uncovered several receptors that different coronaviruses bind to, such as ACE2 for SARS-CoV 29 and CD26 for MERS-CoV. 30 Our molecular modelling showed structural similarity between the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. Therefore, we suggest that 2019-nCoV might use ACE2 as the receptor, despite the presence of amino acid mutations in the 2019-nCoV receptor-binding domain. Although a previous study using HeLa cells expressing ACE2 proteins showed that 2019-nCoV could employ the ACE2 receptor, 37 whether these mutations affect ACE2 binding or change receptor tropism requires further study.Recombination has been seen frequently in coronaviruses. 1 As expected, we detected recombination in the Sarbecoviruses analysed here. Our results suggest that recombination events are complex and are more likely occurring in bat coronaviruses than in 2019-nCoV. Hence, despite its occurrence, recombination is probably not the reason for emergence of this virus, although this inference might change if more closely related animal viruses are identified.In conclusion, we have described the genomic structure of a seventh human coronavirus that can cause severe pneumonia and have shed light on its origin and \\n\\nDeclaration of interests\\n\\nWe declare no competing interests.\\n\\nData sharing\\n\\nData are available on various websites and have been made publicly available (more information can be found in the first paragraph of the Results section).\\n\\n\",\n          \"INTRODUCTION\\n\\nThe post-synaptic density-95, disks-large and zonula occludens-1 (PDZ) domain was identified over 20 years ago (Cho et al., 1992; Itoh et al., 1993; Woods and Bryant, 1991) . It is highly represented in eukaryotes and prokaryotes (Ponting, 1997) and in the human genome over 500 proteins contain PDZ domains (SMART database) (Schultz et al., 1998) . The typical PDZ domain contains approximately 90 amino acids and a tertiary fold that includes six beta strands (b1eb6) and two alpha helices (a1 and a2). PDZ domains themselves have no enzymatic activity but generally recognize the 5e10 C-terminal residues of binding partners acting as scaffolds to mediate the assembly of protein complexes. Through these protein complexes, PDZ proteins regulate a vast number of biological processes including protein trafficking, signal transduction, cellecell junctions, and cell polarity and adhesion. Because of their critical biological significance and association with disease, PDZ proteins, and consequently PDZ domains, have become attractive therapeutic targets. The structural and dynamic properties of PDZ domains have been studied, and in many cases found to aid in fine-tuning their scaffolding and signaling functions. This chapter highlights emerging concepts in PDZ domain structure, specificity, and cellular function and its multifaceted role in human disease.\\n\\nCELLULAR FUNCTION OF PDZ DOMAINe CONTAINING PROTEINS AND THEIR LINK TO DISEASE\\n\\nPDZ proteins are broadly classified into subfamilies based on their overall domain architecture (Harris and Lim, 2001 ). Fig. 1 shows the four subfamilies of PDZ proteins and highlights many of the proteins discussed in this review. The first subfamily comprises membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) proteins that contain multiple PDZ domains and a signature PDZ-SH3-GK structural \\\"supramodule.\\\" A second subfamily is composed of essentially only PDZ domains, functioning exclusively as scaffolding proteins. PDZ proteins may also contain domains with enzymatic functions (e.g., phosphatase, guanine nucleotide exchange, etc.) and these proteins comprise a third subfamily of PDZ proteins. Finally, a growing list of PDZ proteins form a separate PDZ subfamily characterized by the presence of diverse proteineprotein interaction domains that continue to show novel structural and regulatory properties.PDZ proteins have many diverse functions but are widely known for their role in regulating neuronal synaptic signaling and cellecell junctions in most cell types. This function is largely due to the direct binding of PDZ domains with target proteins possessing unique C-terminal PDZ-binding motifs (PBMs) (see Section 3). These interactions help coordinate the trafficking of transmembrane proteins (usually ion transporters) from the Golgi to the plasma membrane and participate in their stabilization at the membrane. The regulation of ion-channel trafficking can ultimately have a significant effect on synaptic signaling. PDZ domains can also act as scaffolds to recruit structural and regulatory components of cellecell junctional complexes to the cytoplasmic membrane. In this section, we will discuss the specific roles of representative PDZ domain proteins involved in important physiological processes associated with disease. Figure 1 Distinct classes of PDZ-containing proteins. Proteins are scaled to the length of their primary sequence. Red brackets indicate that the structure of that region has been determined.\\n\\nCoordination of Pre-and Postsynaptic Signaling in Neuronal Cells\\n\\nCommunication between pre-and postsynaptic neurons (i.e., synaptic transmission) is an essential part of neuronal cell signaling. Critical for this function are the many excitatory receptor proteins whose function is, in part, regulated by PDZ-containing proteins. In excitatory glutamatergic synapses, the neurotransmitter glutamate is released from presynapses and sensed by two ionotropic receptorsda-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptorsdboth of which are able to transport Na \\u00fe , K \\u00fe , and Ca 2\\u00fe (Madden, 2002) . Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) can control ion channels indirectly through G-proteins (Niswender and Conn, 2010) . After ion channel opening, neuronal signals are further decoded and relayed to the postsynaptic density (PSD) region of an adjacent cell. This signal relay is mediated by a set of PDZ-containing proteins including PICK-1 (protein interacting with C kinase 1), GRIP (glutamate receptor interacting protein), CASK (calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase), Shank-3, and most importantly, PSD-95, a major constituent of the PSD ( Fig. 2A ).\\n\\nAMPA Receptor\\n\\nThe AMPA receptor (AMPAR) is a heterotetramer membrane-bound protein comprised of a glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2) dimer and two subunits of GluR1, GluR3, or GluR4. AMPAR is involved in long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) that are critical for memory and learning in mammals (Huganir and Nicoll, 2013) . Studies showed that overexpression of PSD-95, PSD-93, and SAP-102 led to the enhancement in both the frequency and amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic current along with an increase in the number of AMPARs in the PSD region (El-Husseini et al., 2000) , whereas RNA knockdown of PSD-95 or PSD-93 proteins led to 50% reduction of AMPAR molecules at synapses (Schluter et al., 2006) . These data indicate that trafficking of AMPAR is regulated by PSD-95 family proteins. A later study confirmed that this regulation is mediated through endocytosis of AMPAR (Bhattacharyya et al., 2009 ). However, PSD-95 and SAP-102 knockdown were only able to reduce the AMPARmediated neuronal signal transmission in immature synapses, implying developmentally controlled regulation of AMPAR trafficking (Sans et al., 2000) . Among PSD-95 family members, only Dlg1 (also known as SAP-97) interacted directly with AMPAR (Leonard et al., 1998) . Dlg1 can also bind the kinesin motor and myosin-V to deliver AMPAR-containing vesicles along actin and microtubules to dendrites. In contrast, PSD-95 mediates AMPAR trafficking through both a C-terminal PDZ interaction and via an auxiliary scaffold protein (i.e., stargazin), which bridges the interaction between AMPARs and PSD-95 .Other PDZ proteins, such as GRIP and PICK-1 are known to directly bind to AMPARs through the C-termini of the GluR2 subunits. Like Dgl1, GRIP was able to directly interact with a kinesin motor protein and facilitate the targeting of AMPAR to synapses ( Fig. 2A) (Schnapp, 2003) . Interestingly, phosphorylation on GluR2 PBM differently regulates these interactionsdphosphorylation disrupts the with GluR2/GRIP interaction without interfering with the GluR2/PICK-1 interaction. Together, these studies show that PDZ domainemediated interactions regulate AMPAR trafficking to the synapse, which is critical for synaptic plasticity.\\n\\nNMDA Receptor\\n\\nNMDA receptors (NMDAR) are heterotetramer glutamate receptors, consisting of two GluN1 subunits and a combination of GluN2 and/or GluN3 subunits. Like APMAR, NMDAR is involved in regulating LTP and synaptic plasticity. NMDARs were found to interact with SAP-102, PSD-93, and PSD-95 in brain and hippocampus extracts ( Fig. 2A ) (Lau et al., 1996; Sans et al., 2003) . These interactions are mediated through the PDZ domains and the C-termini of NMDAR subunits, such as GluN2A and GluN2B, and may be enhanced by additional interactions, such as binding to the putative SH3-binding motif found in GluN2A subunit (Cousins et al., 2009) . PSD-95 proteins also regulate cellular trafficking, membrane CFTR is associated with NHERF2 and the LPA2 GPCR in a complex. On lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) activation of LPA2, adenylate cyclase (AC) is inhibited through G i resulting in low cAMP levels and inhibition of CFTR. Activation of AC occurs through G s (e.g., adenosine receptor), which increases cAMP levels and CFTR activity. Adapted from Li, C., Naren, A.P., 2010. CFTR chloride channel in the apical compartments: spatiotemporal coupling to its interacting partners. Integr. Biol. (Camb.) 2, 161e177. PDZ Domain Structure and Function targeting, and retention of NMDARs. NMDARs are assembled at the endoplasmic reticulum and trafficking is dependent on its interaction with the PSD-95 family proteins SAP-102 and Dlg1 (Sans et al., 2003) . In addition, CASK, another PDZ domainecontaining protein, was found to interact with the GluN2B and GluN2A subunits to mediate NMDAR trafficking through Golgi networks and Golgi outposts ( Jeyifous et al., 2009) . Like the AMPAR, the PDZ-mediated trafficking processes for NMDAR occurred predominantly during development rather than in mature neurons (El-Husseini et al., 2000; Elias et al., 2008) .In addition to regulating the cellular trafficking of NMDAR, PSD-95 is also involved in the assembly of protein interaction networks in the PSD region. The PSD-95 PDZ1 domain recognizes the C-termini of the GluN2A and GluN2B subunits of NMDAR, whereas PDZ2 domain binds to the neuronal nitric oxide synthases (nNOS) ( Fig. 2A) . The formation of NMDAR/PSD-95/nNOS complex plays significant roles in learning, memory, and social behavior. On the other hand, disruption of this complex couples glutamate signaling to excessive production of NO, which ultimately leads to excitotoxicity (Sattler et al., 1999) . Excitotoxicity has been found in many disorders including ischemic stroke, neuropathic pain, and depression (Doucet et al., 2012; Sattler et al., 1999) . The guanylate kinase (GK) domain of PSD-95 interacts with the GK-associated protein (GKAP), which together bind the Shank-3 PDZ domain to form a ternary complex. Shank-3 is another important scaffold protein that anchors NMDAR to the actin cytoskeleton via PDZ domainemediated interactions (Naisbitt et al., 1999) . Moreover, disruption of these interactions has been seen in synaptic dysfunction and autism spectrum disorders ( Jiang and Ehlers, 2013) .Thus, several PDZ-containing proteins are critical for physiological synaptic function and involved in pathological synaptic disorders. Effective small molecule inhibitors that target unique PDZ domains might be useful for the treatment of excitotoxicity, chronic pain, and Alzheimer's disease rather than targeting ion channels or receptors that usually lead to side effects (D'Mello et al., 2011; Gardoni, 2008; Ittner et al., 2010) . More importantly, these inhibitors could also be used as molecular probes to investigate the role of PDZ domains in regulating synaptic dynamics at the PSD and other signaling pathways.\\n\\nG-Protein Coupled Receptors\\n\\nmGluR is a glutamate receptor and a member of the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) superfamily that regulates ion channels indirectly through downstream signal transduction mediated by G-proteins. Most mGluRs contain PBMs that are recognized by PDZ domains. For instance, mGluR7 interacts with the PICK-1 PDZ domain to regulate receptor cell surface expression and Ca 2\\u00fe channel voltage gating ( Fig. 2A ) (Perroy et al., 2002) . Moreover, mutating C-terminal residues of mGluR7 disrupted receptor trafficking by impeding normal excitatory signaling resulting in epilepsy-like symptoms in rats and mice (Bertaso et al., 2008) .The serotonin (5-HT) GPCR receptor also contains a PBM and interactions between these proteins are important for synaptic signaling. In particular, the 5-HT receptor couples to nNOS signaling and NO production in neuronal cells through a PDZ/receptor interaction ( Fig. 2A ) (Manivet et al., 2000) . PDZ/receptor interactions are also involved in agonist-induced desensitization, which provides yet another way of finetuning GPCR signaling (Romero et al., 2011) . For example, the 5-HT receptor/PSD-95 PDZ1 domain interactions mediated neuropathic pain in a rat model of diabetic neuropathy (Pichon et al., 2010) . Thus, disruption of this PDZ domainemediated interaction could have antihyperalgesic effects for acute and chronic pain.\\n\\nAdherens and Tight Junction Proteins\\n\\nAdherens junctions (AJs) and tight junctions (TJs) are important for the integrity of tissues formed by epithelial cells. AJs provide the physical attachment for cellecell and celleextracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. In contrast, TJs function by forming a semipermeable barrier that regulates the flow of solutes into the paracellular space (the space between cells). Importantly, both AJs and TJs contribute to apicalebasal polarity of cells, which is critical for the physiological function of tissues. Disruption of this polarity leads to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a hallmark of tumor cells (Thiery, 2002) . PDZ proteins are important for both AJ and TJ function (Fig. 2B) . One of the best-known examples is the ZO family of proteins (ZO-1 through 3) (Fanning et al., 2012) . ZO family proteins interact with claudins, a transmembrane protein family found in TJs. Specifically, claudins 1e8 are known to directly bind to the first PDZ domain of the three ZO isoforms using relatively conserved C-termini sequences (-K/S/T-D/N/E/Q-YV coo-) (Itoh et al., 1999) . This interaction is important for the assembly of TJ strands, a set of continuous intramembranous strands observed using electron microscopy. Epithelial cells lacking ZO-1 and ZO-2 fail to maintain the TJ permeability barrier, which can be rescued by reexpression of ZO-1 or ZO-2 (Umeda et al., 2006) . The second PDZ domain of ZO proteins is unique because it mediates homo-and heterodimerization through PDZePDZ domain interactions with other ZO isoforms that are required for the recruitment of claudins to TJs (Umeda et al., 2006; Utepbergenov et al., 2006) . The third PDZ domain in ZO-1 interacts directly with the Ig-like transmembrane protein JAM-1 ( junctional adhesion molecule 1), which also interacts with a PDZ domain in the Par complex.The Partition-defective (Par) polarity complex is another PDZ-containing complex critical for cell junction integrity. The core complex consists of Par-3, Par-6, and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), and the Cdc42 GTPase is critical for its activation. Both Par-3 and Par-6 contain PDZ domains (see Fig. 1 ). Par-6 might be considered the hub of complex assembly because it interacts with the other componentsdit binds aPKC via its N-terminal PB1 domain, Cdc42 through the Cdc42/Rac interactive-binding (CRIB) motif and Par-3 likely through interactions between the Par-6 PDZ and Par-3 PDZ1 domains. Activation of the complex occurs through the Par-6 CRIB/Cdc42\\u2022GTP interaction, connecting the Cdc42 activity with aPKC signaling. Importantly, the Cdc42 interaction allosterically regulates subsequent Par-6 PDZ domain ligand binding events (Peterson et al., 2004) . The Par-3 PDZ3 domain interacts with the C-terminal PBM of JAM-1 to recruit Par-3 and the Par-6eaPKC subcomplex to the regions where ZO protein and claudins localize and control TJ formation (Itoh et al., 2001) . Unlike the Par-3 PDZ1 domain, PDZ2 was shown to interact with phosphatidylinositide phosphates (PIPs). This interaction works in a cooperative manner with the Par-3 PDZ3/PTEN interaction to integrate PIP signaling with the establishment of cell polarity Wu et al., 2007a) .\\n\\nProteoglycan Receptors\\n\\nProteoglycan transmembrane adhesion receptors also bind PDZ-containing proteins. This receptor family consists of three major classes, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), melanoma chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan/neuron/ glia-type 2 antigen (MCSP/NG2) and part-time proteoglycans (neoropilin-1 and CD44), which under some circumstances act as glycoproteins (Couchman, 2010) . Proteoglycans usually sense extracellular molecules, transducing extracellular cues to the signaling apparatus located at the cytoplasmic C-termini that ultimately regulates cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. Dysregulation of this signaling leads to the disruption of various processes (e.g., cell polarity, cell proliferation, immune function, and angiogenesis) typically associated with different vascular diseases and cancers.The syndecan family of proteoglycans, a prominent member of HSPG class, contains four isoforms expressed in different tissues and cells . Syndecans work coordinately with integrin and growth factor coreceptors. Their extracellular polysaccharide chains bind collagen, chemokines, and cytokines to coordinately promote cellematrix adhesion. Their short C-terminal cytoplasmic PBMs interact with several cytoplasmic PDZ-containing proteins, including syntenin, GIPC, CASK, and Tiam1 ( Fig. 2C ) (Cohen et al., 1998; Gao et al., 2000; Grootjans et al., 2000; Shepherd et al., 2010) . These proteins are thought to cluster the syndecan receptors and relay signaling cues to downstream effectors (Tkachenko et al., 2006; Woods et al., 2000) . The syntenin PDZ2 domain was found to regulate the endocytic pathway of syndecan (Zimmermann et al., 2005) . Syntenin can also link syndecans to other cell surface receptors and kinases, such as E-cadherin and ephrin-B through its tandem PDZ domains, establishing signaling crosstalk (Lin et al., 1999; Zimmermann et al., 2001) . In addition to syndecans, other proteoglycans interact with PDZ-domain proteins. For example, MCSP/NG2 clustering was mediated by GRIP-1 PDZ7 domain (Fig. 2C ) (Karram et al., 2005) .Proteoglycan signaling through Rho GTPases controls the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton and contributes to the establishment of cell adhesion. Rho GTPases are regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). GAPs enhance GTP hydrolysis, and thus shut down the GTPase signaling, whereas GEFs catalyze the exchange of GDP to GTP to propagate the signaling event (Hodge and Ridley, 2016) . Rho GEFs can harbor PDZ domains or PBMs and couple proteoglycan receptors to Rho GTPase signaling. For example, syndecan1 is linked to Rac1 signaling through the interaction between the syndecan1 PBM and the PDZ domain of Tiam1, a Rac1-specific GEF. Both cell migration and cell adhesion were impaired on disrupting the PDZ/syndecan-1 interaction (Shepherd et al., 2010) . Moreover, bioinformatics studies indicate that w40% of Rho GEFs contain a PBM at their C-terminus (Garcia-Mata and Burridge, 2007) . Because the number of GEF proteins is 3-fold greater than the number of Rho GTPases, incorporation of PDZ domains and/or PBMs into GEFs can provide signaling specificity.\\n\\nPDZ Proteins as Targets for Pathogenic Viruses\\n\\nIt is now apparent that PDZ domain proteins are important cellular targets of viruses (Table 1) . Adenovirus (Ad), a dsDNA virus responsible for severe respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, was the first virus identified to have proteins that interact with a cellular PDZ protein (Davison et al., 2003) . Several Ad virus subgroups (A, B, and D) induced tumors in rodent cells and within subgroup D, only serotype Ad9 could induce tumors in rats (Hierholzer, 1992) . Ad-infected rat cells displayed distinct mammary tumors, including fibroadenoma, phyllodes tumor, and solid sarcoma ( Javier et al., 1991) . Further analysis showed that the gene inducing these tumors was found in the E4 region of the viral genome, a complex transcriptional unit with six open reading frames (ORF). The E4-ORF1 encodes a protein containing a C-terminal PBM (ATLV coo-), which was the first identified PBM in a viral protein and capable of interacting with both TJs (e.g., ZO-2, PATJ and MUPP-1) and AJs proteins (e.g., Dlg1) . Accumulating evidence indicates that loss of cell polarity and cellecell junctions (i.e., tight and adherens junctions) are important events required for tumorigenesis (Soler et al., 1999) . Dlg1 relies on the interaction between its PDZ2 domain and the PBM of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) for proper establishment of anterioreposterior cell polarity. Disruption of this interaction by the viral E4-ORF1 PBM resulted in increased cellular invasion (Lee et al., 1997) . Additionally, the E4-protein/Dlg1 interaction was recruited to cytosolic membranes resulting in activated Ras/PI3K signaling to support cell proliferation and survival (Frese et al., 2003) . The E4-ORF1 also interacted with ZO-2, PATJ, and MUPP-1 through PDZ domain interactions sequestering these junctional proteins in the cytosol to prevent the formation of normal cellecell junctions (Latorre et al., 2005) . Thus, the Ad9 E4-ORF1 is capable of interacting with various adhesion proteins to disrupt tight junctions and cell polarity; it also interacts with Dlg1 to translocate it to the cell membrane to activate the oncogenic PI3Ksignaling pathway. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) contain over 100 serotypes and are the major cause of genital warts and tumors (zur Hausen, 2002) . HPVs are further categorized into high-risk (e.g., HPV-16 and -18) and low-risk based on their capacity for promoting the EMT and cause cervical cancers (Watson et al., 2003) . In HPV-derived cancer cells, the E6 and E7 oncoproteins are highly expressed. These proteins contributed to the tumorigenesis cooperatively, yet by distinct mechanismsdoverexpression of E7 caused proliferation of cells, whereas E6 mainly led to metastasis (Song et al., 2000) . The C-termini of the E6 oncoproteins in high-risk HPV contain PBMs (ETQV/L coo-) (Table 1) , which are absent in low-risk E6 oncoproteins (Lee et al., 1997) . Dlg1 and Scribble were the first two PDZ-containing proteins identified as E6-binding partners (Kiyono et al., 1997; Nakagawa and Huibregtse, 2000) .Other proteins, such as Na \\u00fe /H \\u00fe exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF-1), MAGI-1, PSD-95, ZO-2, and b-2 syntrophin, were later found to interact with E6 (Pim et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2016) . Again, most of these proteins are involved in establishing cell polarity and maintaining cellecell junctions. The HPV E6/PDZ domain interactions occurred at different stages in cell metastasis and were regulated by phosphorylation (Pim et al., 2012) . In particular, the HPV E6/Dlg1 PDZ1 and PDZ2 interactions regulated tumorigenesis by disrupting cell polarity. The HPV E6/Sribble interaction stimulated the Ras/MAPK signaling to regulate tumorigenesis (Dow et al., 2008) . Furthermore, HPV oncoproteins caused degradation of their targets through the ubiquitineproteasome pathway (Gardiol et al., 1999; Huh et al., 2007) . Specifically, E6 was able to recruit the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A to ubiquitinylate p53, a well-known tumor suppressor, leading to its degradation (Huibregtse and Scheffner, 1991) . Indeed, most of the E6-targeting proteins were degraded by an E6-mediated protease . Therefore, PDZ protein interactions with the C-terminus of E6 not only disrupt normal proteineprotein interactions but also promote degradation of the target protein, ultimately leading to the loss of the proper cellecell junctions and the development of tumors.The human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) is a causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia. It is known to contain two subtypes, HTLV-1 and HTLV-2. HTLV-1 leads to cellular transformation by activating cAMP and NFkB signaling, whereas HTLV-2 has not been related to any lymphoma malignances (Matsuoka and Jeang, 2007) . Analogous to the HPV E6 oncoprotein, the oncoprotein Tax from HTLV-1 has a PBM at its C-terminus (ETEV coo-), whereas HTLV-2 Tax does not contain this motif (Hirata et al., 2004) . In vitro kinase studies showed that the casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylated three Ser/Thr residues near or at the PBM of the Tax protein. A phosphomimetic mutation prevented the binding between Tax protein and Dlg1, implying a phosphorylation-based regulation (Bidoia et al., 2010) . Tax was found to interact with the PDZ domaine containing proteins Scribble and Dlg1 to interfere with cell polarity and immune function, which helped maintain persistent HTLV-1 infections facilitating the development of T-cell leukemia and lymphoma (Arpin-Andre and Mesnard, 2007; Suzuki et al., 1999) . In addition to Tax, the HTLV-1 envelop protein (Env) also harbors a PBM (ESSL coo-) that was shown to bind all three PDZ domains in Dlg1 (Blot et al., 2004) . Moreover, the glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) also forms clusters at the \\\"virological synapse\\\" and acts as a cellular receptor for HTLV-1. GLUT1 functions together with Env to form cellecell contacts and facilitate cell transmission of the virus. Its clustering is recruited and mediated by the interaction between its PBM and Dlg1 PDZ domains (Yoshida et al., 2008) .Other disease-causing viruses, such as rabies, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza, tick-borne encephalitis, and Dengue all possess PBMs in either nonstructural or envelop proteins (Golebiewski et al., 2011; Prehaud et al., 2010; Teoh et al., 2010; Werme et al., 2008) . For example, the envelope glycoprotein (G) in the rabies virus contains a PBM that is critical for virulence. In one virulent strain this PBM is QTRL coo-, which interacts with the PDZ domains of the microtubule associated serine-threonine kinases 1 and 2 (MAST1 and MAST2) to promote virus infection. Interestingly, a nonvirulent attenuated strain was found to have a single mutation in its G envelope protein PBM (Q/ETRL coo-). Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) analyses determined that the mutant PBM was capable of binding several new proteins through PDZ domain interactions, including -protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 4 (PTPN4). Surprisingly, the G envelope-PBM/PTPN4-PDZ interaction was sufficient to trigger cell apoptosis leading to viral attenuation rather than virulence. Therefore, a single Q to E mutation in the viral PBM was capable of regulating the switch from survival to apoptosis in the infected cells (Prehaud et al., 2010) . In the SARS coronavirus, the E envelop protein contains a PBM that interacts with the PDZ domain of PALS1, a member of MAGUK protein family and serves as a TJ regulator (Teoh et al., 2010) . In SARSinfected cells, PALS1 was mislocated to the Golgi leading to the disruption of TJs and apicalebasal polarity, implying a role for the PBM in pathogenesis of SARS-derived lung syndrome (Teoh et al., 2010) . Finally, the NS1 protein from the influenza A virus has a PBM at its C-terminus. Both the avian and human viral NS1 proteins had PBMs, but their sequences were slightly different. The avian NS1 PBM sequence is ESEV coo-and caused a more severe infection than the human version (RSKV coo-) (Soubies et al., 2010) . Subsequently, it was shown that the avian PBM disrupted TJs by binding to Scribble and Dlg1, implying a pathological role in respiratory infection (Golebiewski et al., 2011) .The widespread conservation of PBMs in virus families indicates that this is a common feature and future studies are expected to discover additional examples. The PBMs of most nononcogenic viruses (e.g., rabies, SARS, and influenza) interfere with the establishment of cell polarity and cell junction maintenance and may contribute to viral transmission. This also leads to virulence by impacting the inflammatory responses during infection ( Jackson et al., 2008) . For viruses with oncogenic potential (e.g., Ad, HPV, and HTLV), loss of cell polarity and disruption of the normal cellecell junctions are the initial steps for metastasis. PBMs harbored by oncogenic viruses typically bind to and inactivate proteins that play crucial roles in establishing and maintaining cellular junction events by either altering subcellular localization or mediating their degradation. PBM/ PDZ interactions are also involved in inhibiting the tumor suppressors (e.g., APC) and activating oncoproteins (e.g., PI3K) through association. Indeed, many PBM/PDZ interactions found in oncogenic viruses ultimately result in deregulation of the downstream APC/PI3K signaling, a key pathway for cell proliferation and survival ( James and Roberts, 2016) . In addition, these interactions can inhibit apoptosis and promote proliferation resulting in tumorigenesis along with viral replication. Thus, effective disruption of interactions between cellular PDZ domains and viral PBMs using small molecule inhibitors may be a feasible therapeutic strategy against viral infection and viral-mediated tumorigenesis (see Section 4).\\n\\nWnt Signaling\\n\\nThe Wnt signaling pathway is critical for embryonic development, cell proliferation, and cell migration. Importantly, this pathway is regulated by PDZ domain interactions. The Wnt protein is a secreted growth factor conserved from Drosophila to Homo sapiens (Clevers, 2006) . The cell surface receptor for Wnt is Frizzled, a seven transmembrane helix protein with an additional extracellular ligand-binding domain and a cytoplasmic domain. The cytoplasmic domain has two independent PBMs, an internal membrane proximal PBM recognized by the Dishevelled (Dvl) PDZ domain and a membrane distal C-terminal PBM recognized by several PDZ domains (Fig. 2D ). The Dvl PDZ domain is able to recognize all Frizzled isoforms, which are expressed under tight spatiotemporal regulation (Malbon and Wang, 2005) . However, other PDZ domains have unique specificities for targeting the membrane distal PBM. For example, PSD-95 PDZ2 recognizes Frizzled-1, 2, 4, and 7, whereas Kermit (Xenopus laevis ortholog of GIPC) specifically binds to Frizzled-3 and 7 (Hering and Sheng, 2002) . Moreover, Frizzled receptors are coupled to distinct downstream signaling molecules, such as syndecan, PKC, APC, and Rho GTPases, via different PDZ domain interactions to regulate a wide spectrum of cellular functions (Wawrzak et al., 2009) . Crosstalk between Wnt signaling and these pathways is important for synapse formation, early heart morphogenesis, and neural crest induction in Drosophila and Xenopus (Ataman et al., 2006; Hamblet et al., 2002; Wallingford and Harland, 2002) . Therefore, distinct PDZ domain proteins interact with different Frizzled receptors contributing to the specificity and complexity of Wnt signaling.Wnt/Frizzled/Dvl signaling is divided into canonical and noncanonical pathways based on the destiny of b-catenin (Fig. 2D ). In the absence of Wnt, the canonical Wnt-signaling pathway results in b-catenin degradation and downregulation of planar cell polarity (Clevers, 2006) . On Wnt binding to Frizzled and the LRP5/6 coreceptor, Dvl and is recruited to the membrane resulting in the block of b-catenin degradation. The b-catenin transcriptional coactivator is now available to enter the nucleus and promote TCF-dependent transcription to regulate cell movement and establish cell polarity. Dvl can also interact with different effectors, such as Dapper, b-arrestin, CK1 and 2, through its PDZ domain to reinforce b-catenin degradation and planar cell polarity signaling. The noncanonical Wnt pathway leads to planar cell polarity, in part, through the recruitment of the ROR2 tyrosine kinase coreceptor to the Frizzled receptor and the activation of Rho GTPases (Fig. 2D) . Cytoplasmic Dvl forms a complex with the adapter protein Daam1 and the WGEF, a RhoA GEF (Habas et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2008b; Tanegashima et al., 2008) . In addition, Dvl can form a complex with Tiam1, a Rac1 GEF (Cajanek et al., 2013; Saxena et al., 2015) . These complexes rearrange the actin cytoskeleton to reinforce cell polarity. Because of the central role of Dvl and its PDZ domain in regulating the two Wnt pathways, Dvl is thought to function as a hub where distinct interactions dictate downstream binding partners and signaling events (Gao and Chen, 2010) . Interestingly, a recent study found that Dvl is autoinhibited through the interaction of the PDZ domain and its own PBM. Conformational changes between the autoinhibited and open states can distinctly regulate canonical and noncanonical pathways (Qi et al., 2017) . The Dvl PDZ domain also plays crucial roles in Wnt-driven tumorigenesis. For instance, abnormal activation of Wnt signaling along with upregulation of Dvl drives overexpression of cMyc and Cyclin D1 genes associated with colon cancer, melanomas, and leukemia (Clevers, 2006; Morin et al., 1997) . Consequently, understanding the mechanism that fine-tunes PDZ-domain recognition in Wnt signaling would be extremely useful for dissecting Wnt biology. Additionally, the Dvl PDZ domain is an attractive cellular target for development of potent inhibitors for cancer therapies.\\n\\nCFTR Signaling\\n\\nCystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion (Cl \\u00c0 ) channel regulated by local cAMP concentration, protein kinase A (PKA) activity, and proteineprotein interactions (Anderson et al., 1991) . It functions to control the ion/fluid balance required for the clearance of mucus. PDZ domainecontaining proteins are key regulators of CFTR signaling (Fig. 2E) . A key PDZ domainecontaining protein regulator is the NHERF (Raghuram et al., 2001) . NHERF-1, 2, 3, and 4 have been shown to interact with the C-terminal PBM of CFTR to anchor this channel to the apical membrane in epithelial cells. Other PDZ proteins such as CAL (CFTR-associated ligand) and Shank-2 also interact with CFTR. Unlike the aforementioned PDZ proteins, CAL interacts with CFTR to localize and retain it to the Golgi and mediate the endocytosis process (Li and Naren, 2010) . Thus, PDZ domain-mediated interactions with CFTR play critical roles in membrane recruitment and internalization of this ion channel to further modulate ion conductivity and mucus thickness.\\n\\nDiseases Related to PDZ Proteins and Their Interaction Partners\\n\\nA substantial literature shows that PDZ/PBM interactions are involved in many significant cellular processes, thus it is not surprising that dysfunction of these interactions contributes to a variety of human malignancies (Table 2) . Three general diseases linked to PDZ domain proteins are neurological disorders, cancer, and cystic fibrosis (CF), which will be discussed here.Neurological disorders are linked with several PDZ domainecontaining proteins. Loss of active Dlg1 was associated with altered glutamate signaling in schizophrenic patients (Toyooka et al., 2002) . PSD-95 has been shown to interact with three major glutamate receptors such as AMPAR, NMDAR, and 5-HT receptor and the downstream effector nNOS. Other PDZ proteins, such as PICK-1 and GRIP1, interact with C-terminal PBM of AMPAR to relay signaling cascades. These and other proteineprotein interactions govern the organization and plasticity of synapses and contribute to various neurologic disorders, including pain, depression, and stroke. PSD-95 interacts with a network of proteins to establish the PSD region. The interaction with neuroligin (NLGN), a postsynaptic transmembrane critical for neuronal function, occurs through its C-terminal PBM. PSD-95 interacts with GKAP through its GK domain, whereas the C-terminus of GKAP associates with the Shank-3 PDZ domain. In the presynaptic cleft, the ligand of NLGN is neurexin (NRXN), which is recognized by the CASK PDZ domain. CASK then binds to Mint1 protein, which mediates presynaptic signaling by its PDZ domain. The interactions between NRXN, NLGN, and other PDZ domain proteins are important for synaptic signal transduction and required for synaptic efficacy and plasticity. Dysfunction in this network leads to cognitive diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia (Sudhof, 2008) . PDZ domainemediated interactions play significant roles in tumorigenesis. The upregulation of the Wnt-signaling pathway leads to the transcription of cMyc and Cyclin D1 and is associated with tumor formation and cancer progression (Weeraratna et al., 2002; Yuzugullu et al., 2009) . Indeed, the PDZ domainecontaining protein Dvl is highly overexpressed in breast and lung cancer, whereas deletion of its PDZ domain leads to downregulation of c-myc expression and suppression of tumorigenesis in malignant mesothelioma (Nagahata et al., 2003; Uematsu et al., 2003b) . These data suggest that PDZ domainemediated interactions in Wnt signaling can drive tumorigenesis. PDZ domains in cellecell junctional proteins are regulators of EMT, an important process where cellecell adhesion is lost and invasion is promoted. Specifically, PDZ-mediated interactions in the Par complex are critical for apicalebasal polarity and dysregulated in many tumors. In addition, the Par complex is a downstream effector of TGF signaling, which can promote cell transformation (Aranda et al., 2008) . Additionally, both PDZ domains and PBMs are found in Rho family GEF proteins, and dysfunction of these interactions results in the inappropriate activation of GTPase signaling and actin remodeling, a potential link to cancer metastasis. Overexpression of PDZ domainecontaining GEF LARG was found in patients having high propensity to develop acute myeloid leukemia (Rujkijyanont et al., 2007) . Overexpression of the Tiam1 GEF has been shown in many cancers such as breast, colon, prostate, and melanoma and contributes to the invasion and metastasis (Adams et al., 2010; Choi et al., 2010; Engers et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2010) . Cell adhesion receptors, CADM1 and syndecan1, can directly bind to the PDZ domain of Tiam1 leading to activation of the Rac1 GTPase and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton (Masuda et al., 2010; Shepherd et al., 2010) . Reciprocally, disruption of Tiam1 PDZ domainemediated interactions affects Rac1 activation and cell migration (Shepherd et al., 2010) . Moreover, some tumor suppressors, such as APC and the PTPN phosphatase, harbor PBMs at their C-termini. Disruption of PDZ/PBM interactions in these proteins results in cell proliferation and is found in cancers (Miyoshi et al., 1992; Pedemonte et al., 1998) . Importantly, these interactions are frequently the cellular targets for oncogenic viruses ( Javier, 2008) . Viruses also target hostcellular junctional PDZ proteins such as Dlg1, MAGI, and ZO-2. Perturbation of the cognate PDZ interactions coupled with the hijacking tumor suppressor proteins allows oncogenic viral proteins to promote cell migration and transformation, facilitating the initiation and development of mammary tumors, lymphoma malignances, and cervical cancers. Viruses without oncogenic potential also interact with cell junctional proteins to increase their replication, disseminate in the host, and transmit to new host cells.A number of proteins play crucial roles in the trafficking and function of CFTR, the molecular cause of CF. CFTR is a Cl \\u00c0 channel activated by local cAMP and functions to regulate the ion/fluid balance for the clearance of mucus. Dysregulation of CFTR signaling impairs transportation of ions across the epithelial membrane and causes the accumulation of thick, viscous mucus in the lungs that blocks the airway (Riordan, 2008) . This also leads to various CF-related disorders in the pancreas, kidneys, and intestine. CFTR DF508 (a deletion of residue F508) is the most common mutation in CFTR and results in inefficient folding of the protein, decreased channel activity, and rapid degradation (Guggino and Stanton, 2006) . The rapid degradation of DF508 CFTR is mediated by the interaction of the CFTR PBM with the CAL PDZ protein (Cheng et al., 2002; Lukacs et al., 1993; Swiatecka-Urban et al., 2005) . The CAL PDZ domain functions as an important regulator of CFTR endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, reducing the CFTR levels at the plasma membrane (Cheng et al., 2004) . In contrast, the NHERF-1 and -2 PDZ domains interact with and stabilize CFTR activity at the membrane (Raghuram et al., 2001) . However, the NHERF-2 PDZ also binds to the lysophosphatidic acid 2 (LPA2) receptor at the apical membrane (Lin and Lai, 2008) , and this binding can activate G i GTPase signaling to reduce the local cAMP concentration and PKA activity ( Fig. 2E ) (Li et al., 2005a) . This, in turn, causes the loss of CFTR activity resulting in respiratory and gastrointestinal defects.Together, PDZ/PBM interaction networks regulate synaptic transmission and plasticity and the establishment and maintenance of cell adhesion and junction. Therefore, dysregulation of these interactions contributes to the development of neurological disease, cancers, and viral infection. Additionally, a variety of PDZ-mediated protein complexes fine-tune the activity of CFTR, which directly affects CF. Targeting these PDZ/PBM interactions with small-molecule inhibitors is an emerging area that shows promise for dissecting the biology and development of novel therapeutic agents to treat disease (see section 5).\\n\\nCANONICAL PDZ DOMAINeBINDING MOTIFS AND NOVEL LIGANDS\\n\\nPDZ domains consist of w90 amino acids folded into six b strands and two a helices arranged in a b1eb2eb3ea1eb4eb5ea2eb6 pattern with loops of variable length connecting the elements of secondary structure (Fig. 3A ). The N-and C-termini of PDZ domain are relatively close in space, supporting its role as small globular proteineprotein interaction module. The C-terminal peptide ligand interacts with the PDZ domain through a binding groove formed by the b2 stand and a2 helix and makes additional interactions with residues located along the b1eb2 loop, known as the carboxylate-binding loop. All PDZ domains share this conserved bbarrel fold, yet have variations on the canonical structure. For example, the Erbin PDZ domain contains only one a helix, lacking the short a helix between the b3 and b4 strands (Birrane et al., 2003) , whereas the Tiam1 PDZ domain has only five b strands (Liu et al., 2013) . However, the absence of these structural elements does not affect the global structure of the PDZ domain. Other structural elements, in particular the b2eb3 loop region, can vary in length. Importantly, loop length has been correlated with dynamic motions and contributes to ligand specificity (Shepherd et al., 2010; Tyler et al., 2010) .\\n\\nC-Terminal PDZ-Binding Motifs\\n\\nThe canonical binding motif of a PDZ domain is the C-terminus of cognate interaction proteins. For convenience and by convention, the extreme C-terminal residue of the PDZ domain ligand is defined as position 0 (or P 0 ) and the remaining residues are numbered in reverse order (P -1 , P -2 , P -3 , etc.) from the C-to N-terminus. Similarly, individual binding pockets or sites in the PDZ domain are described by S X , where X indicates the ligand residue proximal to the pocket. Using this notation, the side chain of the P 0 residue in the ligand is described as interacting with residues in the S 0 pocket of the PDZ domain (Fig. 3B) .Initial studies suggested that the PBMs are short, linear peptide regions (typically four amino acids) derived from C-termini of natural proteins.One of the most significant studies used a synthetic peptide library approach to screen for potential ligands for individual PDZ domains (Songyang et al., 1997) . Immobilized PDZ domains were used to screen an oriented peptide library and the retained peptides were chemically sequenced as a pool. These data were then used to determine the consensus binding motif for several PDZ domains, giving rise to original classification scheme. The two major classes described were: class I (XeS/T-X-F coo-) and class II (X-F-X-F coo-), where F represents a hydrophobic residue and X can be any residue (Fig. 4A ), which suggested a strong selectivity at P 0 and P -2 . PDZ domains also display unique amino acid sequence signatures that are consistent with the ligand classification scheme. For example, PDZ domains that bind class I ligands have either a conserved His or Arg residue in the a2 helix near the S -2 pocket that forms a hydrogen bond with a Ser/Thr hydroxyl of the ligand at position P -2 (Fig. 3B ). In contrast, PDZ domains that do not have a basic residue at P -2 (e.g., Val/Leu/Asp) select for (B) Detailed classification based on a large-scale phage display study using peptide residues from P 0 to P -6 (Tonikian et al., 2008) . (C) The a1-syntrophin PDZ showing predicted residues involved in PBM-binding specificity. The 16 residues that interact with the P 0 to P -4 residues of the peptide ligand are labeled (PDB code: 2PDZ). hydrophobic residues (e.g., Phe or Tyr). Subsequent studies with the nNOS and Mint1 PDZ domains identified new PBMs that did not fit either class I and II consensus sequences. Accordingly, class III (X-D/E-X-F coo-) and IV (D-X-W-C coo-) were proposed ( Fig. 4A ) (Bezprozvanny and Maximov, 2001; Maximov et al., 1999; Songyang et al., 1997; Stricker et al., 1997) .Modifications of the original peptide library screening technique were carried out to increase the size of the library and efficiency of screening. These methods include SPOT synthesis and one-bead-one-compound strategy. SPOT synthesis allows parallel synthesis and screening of peptides on individual \\\"spots\\\" on a sheet of cellulose membrane (Frank, 2002) . Further modification of SPOT synthesis allowed for a free C-terminus that made it useful for profiling PDZ-mediated interactions . These studies identified many new PBMs for known PDZ domains, including the Erbin PDZ domain (Boisguerin et al., 2007; Wiedemann et al., 2004) . The one-bead-one-compound strategy utilizes a specialized resin coated with a peptide ending with X -4 X -3 X -2 X -1 X 0,COOH . X -4 eX 0 represents any amino acid and thus constitutes a library with theoretical diversity of 20 5 . This approach was first used to screen binding partners of NHERF-1 PDZ domain and recently used to find potential ligands for both the Tiam1 and Tiam2 PDZ domain ( Joo and Pei, 2008; Shepherd et al., 2011) . By constructing a position-weighted matrix, analysis of the ligand amino acid sequence data allowed for classification into four distinct subgroups for both Tiam1 and Tiam2 PDZ domains. Thus, even within a PDZ protein several distinct motifs may exist. Validation of individual peptides led to the conclusion that the Tiam1 and Tiam2 PDZ domain specificities were overlapping, but distinct (Shepherd et al., 2011) . Phage display methods have also been used to determine the specificity of PDZ domains. Tonikian et al. (2008) discovered over 3000 peptide ligands that bind 82 human and Caenorhabditis elegans PDZ domains. Analysis of the identified peptide sequences indicated that at least the last seven C-terminal residues of ligands were involved in PDZ domain interactions. Using positions P 0 through P -6 , PDZ ligands could be categorized into distinct classes (Fig. 4B ). This classification included the original four classes, but further expanded into a total of 16 classes. Importantly, these classes were conserved in both the C. elegans and human PDZ domains, implying that specificity is not significantly more complex with increasing genome size (Tonikian et al., 2008) . The combination of phage display and next-generation sequencing produces a large database of individual variants that can be analyzed using bioinformatic methods. This methodology has been used to successfully discover new binding partners of PDZ domains, including those from viral proteins (Ivarsson et al., 2014; McLaughlin and Sidhu, 2013) . Some binding pairs displayed high specificity but weak affinity, which might be further optimized through rapid evolution (Ernst et al., 2009) . Hence, phage display has been powerful in providing a broader classification, defining novel ligand-binding specificity and identifying new binding partners of PDZ domains. However, the prediction of potential PDZ/PBM interaction based on phage display data should be examined carefully as it may be biased toward hydrophobic interactions, whereas natural PBMs frequently contain hydrophilic peptides as well .Protein microarray technology has been developed and applied to identify and quantify PDZ/ligand interactions. This technology uses recombinant PDZ domain proteins spotted onto an aldehyde-presenting glass plate in a 96-well format followed by the addition of fluorescently labeled synthetic peptides as a platform to investigate PDZ/ligand specificity and affinity. The initial study used 22 PDZ domains and 20 PBMs to benchmark the method, resulting in the characterization of 520 PDZ/ligand combinations (Stiffler et al., 2006) . A more comprehensive study used 157 mouse PDZ domains and 217 peptides derived from the mouse proteome (Stiffler et al., 2007) . This large-scale study found that the P 0 residue of the PBM was less important in defining specificity and affinity than previously thought, and that residues P -1 through P -4 all contributed significantly to PDZ binding. Further analyses of this dataset suggested that PDZ domains do not fall into unique specificity classes; instead, selectivity is a property distributed throughout the PBM and PDZ domain. Therefore, it was concluded that the ligand-binding specificity of PDZ domains from the mouse proteome was intrinsically optimized, even though it could be further regulated by expression level and cellular localization. In a subsequent study, the PDZ array dataset was used to train a predictive model established using an interaction matrix. This matrix constituted 38 possible interactions, formed between 16 residues on the binding surface of the a1-syntrophin PDZ domain and 5 residues from its cognate C-terminal ligand (Fig. 4C ). Based on these interactions, a Bayesian estimation protocol was developed to predict the binding capacity of PDZ domains using only their primary sequence as input. The model had reasonable predictive power and accuracy in identifying new interactions in other organisms and changes in affinity after PDZ mutations (Chen et al., 2008b) . This study is noteworthy because the prediction was based exclusively on the primary sequence of the PDZ domain. These interactions came from 16 different positions in the PDZ domain but only 5 in the peptide, suggesting that several residues in PDZ domain cooperate to recognize a single position in the peptide, reinforcing the idea that residues from P 0 to P -4 cooperatively contribute to ligand-binding process.The techniques discussed so far have been mostly in vitro and used to predict potential PDZ/PBM interactions that might occur in cells; however, they neglect the influence of other cellular factors and domains in full-length proteins on specificity. To assess the PDZ/ligand interactions in vivo, a quantitative fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)ebased method was developed (You et al., 2006) . This method takes advantage of CyPet and YPet, an optimized pair of cyan and yellow fluorescent protein, to detect a FRET signal with expanded dynamic range in a high-throughput and real-time fashion in Escherichia coli cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Nguyen and Daugherty, 2005) . The method was applied to the PSD-95 PDZ2 domain to screen for ligands from a random peptide library. A new set of ligands were identified, which were missed in a previous Y2H screening experiment (Bassand et al., 1999) . In addition, direct binding and an apparent affinity (K d ) could be determined by this method. This method, in principle, could provide a direct measure of PDZ/ligandbinding affinity in a cellular environment. With the advancement of technology, it could be widely used in yeast and mammalian cells to identify novel in vivo PBMs in a quantitative and real-time manner. The main limitation of FRET-based systems has been the relatively low S/N ratio during image detection. This limitation can be overcome by luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET)ebased methods. Rajapakse et al. (2010) have developed a novel LRET method to characterize PDZ/ligand interactions in mammalian cells (Rajapakse et al., 2010) . Briefly, the proteins to be examined are fused to E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR) labeled with a luminescent terbium complex (TMP-Lumi4) or GFP. On binding, this pair readily produces an LRET signal. The longer lifetime and larger Stokes shift of this LRET signal enables time-resolved detection of wellseparated emission signals. In this first application, the ZO-1 PDZ1 domain was fused to eDHFR, whereas the C-terminal PBM of claudin1 was incorporated into GFP. A positive interaction between PDZ1/claudin1 was detected with more than six fold signal over negative control. Thus, LRET techniques may prove to be a powerful in vivo-imaging method to investigate PDZ domainebased interactions in mammalian cells. Further modification of this technique incorporating an efficient probe delivery and 96 or higher well plate format could enable the screening of potential PDZ ligands or small-molecule inhibitors in a high-throughput fashion.In summary, PBMs of C-terminal peptides are the predominant ligands of PDZ domains. After many PBMs were identified using efficient screening methods, the original PDZ/PBM classification appeared to be oversimplified. The classification based on the chemical properties of P -2 alone is not sufficient to explain and predict the binding specificity. With the advancement of a wide range of large-scale techniques, the classification of these PDZ domains has been challenged and evolved. Moreover, it is now becoming clear that regions outside the C-terminal four residues can also be important in defining affinity and specificity (Bezprozvanny and Maximov, 2001; Birrane et al., 2003; Luck et al., 2012; Tyler et al., 2010; Vaccaro and Dente, 2002) . In particular, there is evidence that residues outside the canonical binding groove also contribute to binding specificity. Although much has been learned about the rules for binding specificity, predicting ligand partners from sequence alone is still a formidable challenge. Because the sheer number of PDZ domains is vast, it is likely new insights and unexpected modes of binding remain to be discovered. Novel large-scale high-throughput screens (in vitro and in vivo) combined with quantitative analyses of binding will likely contribute significantly to future studies (Reich et al., 2014) .\\n\\nInternal Binding Motifs\\n\\nAlthough the canonical PBM is the C-terminus of partner proteins, PDZ domains can also bind to their partners using noncanonical internal motifs that do not involve the C-terminus. The first identified internal PDZ peptide motif was found in nNOS and mediated the interaction with the a1-syntrophin PDZ domain . This interaction helps subcellular localization of the complex in skeletal muscle cells, where NO is produced on muscle contraction and leads to dilation of arteries (Brenman et al., 1995) . Syntrophin and nNOS form a PDZePDZ heterodimer mediated by a b-hairpin finger motif found at the C-terminus of the nNOS PDZ domain (Fig. 3C) . The b-hairpin finger docks into the canonical syntrophin PDZ domain ligand groove using the b-turn located between the two bstrands of the b-hairpin finger. Importantly, the penultimate b-strand packs into the binding groove rather than the classical free C-terminus. This internal peptide-binding mechanism did not impact the ligand-binding pocket of the nNOS PDZ domain, which could still bind canonical C-terminal peptide ligands. Thus, the heterodimer configuration provides syntrophin with the capacity to bind new proteins via the nNOS PDZ domain.The Par-6 PDZ domain has also been found to bind a noncanonical internal ligand. The Par-6 PDZ domain recognizes an internal peptide of PALS1 through a different mechanism compared to the a1-synthrophin PDZ (Hurd et al., 2003; Penkert et al., 2004) . Instead of a b-hairpin finger motif, the Par-6 PDZ domain uses an extended eight amino acid linear motif. The crystal structure of Par-6 PDZ in complex with an internal PALS1 peptide showed that the P 0 Val (using the same convention as C-terminal ligands) and three additional residues C-terminal of this Val (referred as P \\u00fe1 , P \\u00fe2 , and P \\u00fe3 ) also contributed to the interaction (Fig. 3D) . Within this extension, the side chain of P \\u00fe1 Asp formed a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Lys165 found in the PDZ domain carboxyl binding loop, mimicking the role of the C-terminal carboxyl group. Mutating P \\u00fe1 Asp to Ala or Asn abolished binding to the PDZ domain, suggesting an important role for the proper conformation of the carboxylate-binding loop. The Par-6 PDZ domain also binds to canonical ligands such as the C-terminus of Crb3. Moreover, the binding between the Cdc42 and the Par-6 CRIB motif enhances the Crb3 ligand affinity to the PDZ domain allosterically by regulating the conformation of the carboxylbinding loop. Interestingly, Cdc42 binding to the CRIB domain did not enhance PALS1 affinity suggesting that the same loop was already in the appropriate conformation to bind the internal ligand .In addition to syntrophin and Par-6 PDZ domains, other PDZ domains bind internal targets. For example, the Dvl PDZ binds an internal ligand in the Frizzled receptor whereas the b2-syntrophin PDZ domain binds an internal sequence in the Tiam1 GEF (Mack et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2003) . Despite a lack of structural details for these interactions, they play critical roles in regulating cellecell junction, muscle contraction, and cell proliferation. More recently, a study using all the PDZ domains from C. elegans found that internal sequences mediated noncanonical binding on a genome-wide scale, much more frequently than previously appreciatedd w51% of the PDZ domains did not associate with a classical C-terminal ligand (Lenfant et al., 2010) . Similarly, a recent study used a Y2H and a random internal sequence library to determine that 14 out of 24 tested PDZ domains are capable of binding internal peptide sequences (Mu et al., 2014) . These studies underscore the prevalence, and likely the significance of internal PDZ-binding motifs has been underestimated. The capacity for binding internal ligands in addition to C-terminal ligands enable PDZ domains to sense distinct binding signals and connect signaling pathways in an unprecedented manner, complicating PDZ signaling. Finally, the biophysical rationale for internal ligand specificity has yet to be determined, and future studies should help elucidate the rules for specificity.\\n\\nIntra-and Interprotein PDZePDZ Domain Interactions\\n\\nPDZ domainecontaining proteins can dimerize and even oligomerize. This oligomerization can be mediated by PDZ domains, as first seen in the INAD protein (Xu et al., 1998) . PDZ-mediated self-association was found later in EBP50 (Fouassier et al., 2000) and also with NHERF-1/2 homo-and heterodimer (Lau and Hall, 2001) . Structural studies showed the interaction surface of PDZ6 homodimer from GRIP-1 (Fig. 5A ) (Im et al., 2003b) . This surface contained antiparallel packing of the b1 strand with a buried surface area over 600 \\u00c5 2 . Moreover, this b1 strandemediated dimerization did not disturb the ligand-binding groove. Therefore, this PDZ domain dimer can be formed in both apo and ligand-bound states without affecting PBM binding. Further analysis of this GRIP-1 PDZ6 dimer interface showed Tyr671 was an important residue as the Y671D mutation disrupted the hydrophobic interaction leading to monomeric species in solution. A similar dimer packing was found in the Shank-1 PDZ domain dimer, although the orientation of b1 strand was altered (Im et al., 2003a) . This new b1 strand orientation caused a change in the binding pocket, which might facilitate recognition of the ligand for the dimer more efficiently at sites near the cytoplasmic membrane. Both structures suggest a new dimeric interaction of proteins mediated by the PDZ domain. These interactions in both proteins are crucial for forming homodimers or heterodimers, likely facilitating the assembly of multiprotein complexes including rhodopsin, protein kinase C, and calmodulin (Xu et al., 1998) .The ZO-1 PDZ2 domain offers another variation on PDZ dimerization. ZO-1 was found to form a stabilized dimer both in vitro and in vivo, and this dimerization required the second PDZ domain (Utepbergenov et al., 2006) . A subsequent structural study highlighted the unique b-strandeswapped dimer ( Fig. 5B ) (Chen et al., 2008a; Fanning et al., 2007) . The b2 strand from one monomer was inserted into the adjacent PDZ domain packing next to the b3 strand. A large number of interdomain interactions, including hydrogen bond and hydrophobic contacts were identified that stabilized the dimer. These interactions were more extensive than those found with GRIP-1 or Shank-1 PDZ dimers. This unique topology made the binding pocket available for two ligands simultaneously. Interestingly, the proline residue at P -5 in the connexin43 ligand turned the N-terminal residues by almost 90 to avoid a steric clash with the second ligand. The N-terminal residues were accommodated by a chargeecharge interaction network found in the enlarged binding pocket around the extended b2-b3 strand. The dimer was necessary for ligand binding as a mutational insertion in the b2/b3 loop prevented dimer formation and impeded binding with the connexin43 C-terminus. Sequence alignment showed that the ZO-2 and ZO-3 PDZ2 domains are highly conserved with ZO-1, suggesting a similar dimerization mechanism. Indeed, ZO-2 PDZ2 homodimers and ZO-2/ZO-1 heterodimers were formed in vitro and in vivo. Also, the NMR structure of the dimerized ZO-2 PDZ2 showed a similar domainswapped topology, supporting a general role of dimerization throughout the ZO family (Wu et al., 2007b) . In summary, the swapped dimer in PDZ2 domain coupled with other structural features enhanced its ligand (such as in connexin43)-binding specificity and affinity, contributing to the effective association of ZO-1 to the connexin membrane channel. Furthermore, this specific dimer packing could promote the self-association and clustering of this scaffold protein at the cytoplasmic membrane, which might trigger the oligomerization of other cell junction proteins at the membrane through other PDZ domain (such as PDZ1 or PDZ3)emediated interaction.Although these individual PDZ studies describe several cases of PDZe PDZ interactions, their generality was still a question. A recent large-scale study has provided some insight for the overall frequency of PDZePDZ dimerization. Using protein microarray technology, Chang et al. utilized 157 mouse PDZ domains to asses 12,403 potential dimerization events . Primary hits were further validated using a solutionbased fluorescence polarization (FP) assay with 37 PDZ dimer interactions between 46 PDZ domains confirmed. This indicated that w30% of mammalian PDZ domains are involved in dimer interactions. Among these interactions, the tighter ones (with K d < 5 mM) were confirmed in vivo in the context of full-length proteins. Bioinformatics studies showed this dimerization functioned significantly in assembling and strengthening the multiple protein complexes. The mechanism by which these newly identified PDZ domains dimerize is not known and additional structural work waits completion. Further investigation should also focus on the specific cellular function of the identified PDZ pairs.\\n\\nPhosphatidylinositol and Cholesterol Binding\\n\\nIt is well known that cell signal transduction pathways can be regulated by a variety of proteineprotein and proteinelipid interactions. PIPs are a major class of signaling phospholipids found in mammalian cell membranes. PIPs can recognize and recruit proteins to cellular membranes through diverse proteinePIP-binding domains (e.g., PH, FYVE, ANTH, BATS, FERM, PX and PTB) (Balla, 2005; Kutateladze, 2006 Kutateladze, , 2010 Ravichandran et al., 1997) . More recently, it has become evident that PDZ domains can also bind PIPs.The PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains of syntenin1 were the first PDZ domains reported to interact with PIPs. Syntenin1 was found to localize to cellular membranes in a process that depended on phospholipase C activation and the formation of PI(4,5)P 2 . Moreover, this localization was lost after the breakdown of PI(4,5)P 2 (Zimmermann et al., 2001) . The PI(4,5)P 2 -binding sites on the two syntenin1 PDZ domains were localized to basic residues in the carboxylate-binding loop and a2 helix through mutational analysis (Zimmermann et al., 2002) . Recently, the structure of syntenin1 PDZ2 domain bound to both PI(4,5)P 2 lipid and a C-terminal peptide from Frizzled-7 was solved (Fig. 6A) . Although only the inositol ring and phosphates 4 and 5 were unambiguously modeled, it precisely showed the lipid-binding site. The PIP 2 head group was bound into a pocket, formed mostly by positively charged residues in the b2eb3 loop (K214) and a2 helix (K250). Interestingly, the P -5 Lys residue in the Frizzled-7 ligand also interacted with phosphate 5 of the inositol ring. This unprecedented interaction, along with SPR studies, indicated cooperative binding between phospholipid and peptide ligand in the syntenin1 PDZ2 domain (Egea-Jimenez et al., 2016) .The Par-3 PDZ2 domain binds to PI(3,4,5)P 3 , and this interaction was found to be important for the regulation of cell polarity via the Par polarity complex. Using an NMR-based titration assay, PI(3,4,5)P 3 was found to bind the Par-3 PDZ2 domain near the a2eb6 and b1eb2 loops (Fig. 6B ). This surface contains several charged residues that were shown to be important for PIP binding, indicating the significance of electrostatics in phospholipid recognition (Wu et al., 2007a) . A similar patch of positively charged residues was shown to be important for binding PIPs in the PICK-1 PDZ domain (Fig. 6C) . Moreover, a conserved peptide motif (CyseProe Cys) near the b2eb3 loop was shown to facilitate the phospholipid association to the PICK-1 PDZ domain via penetration into the membrane. By utilizing this interaction, the PICK-1 PDZ domain controlled synaptic trafficking of AMPARs in neurons (Pan et al., 2007) .The different phospholipid-binding surfaces described above indicate several possible PDZePIP-binding modes and beckon the question of whether classical PDZ domain ligands and phospholipids generally bind simultaneously or are mutually exclusive. In the case of the Par-3 PDZ2 domain, binding data suggested peptide and phospholipid binding were mutually exclusive (Wu et al., 2007a) . Similarly, competitive binding was found for the ZO-1 (and ZO-2) PDZ2 domains as binding of PI(4,5)P 2 prevented the interaction with peptide ligands (Meerschaert et al., 2009) . In contrast, the two conserved phospholipid-binding regions in the PICK-1 PDZ domain did not overlap with the peptide ligand-binding site, suggesting that both ligands bind simultaneously and contribute to membrane recruitment (Pan et al., 2007) . The CASK PDZ domain also showed synergy between PIP and ligand binding. Binding of PIP(4,5)P 2 was enhanced 4-fold in the presence of the peptide ligand (Ivarsson et al., 2013) . Together, these studies indicate that the particular structural context of the interaction will dictate whether C-terminal peptide ligands and PIPs bind simultaneously or are mutually exclusive. In the case of simultaneous binding there are hints that the interaction may be cooperative. Future efforts will be necessary to fully understand the biophysical nature and physiological significance of this cooperativity.Given that PDZ domains are highly prevalent, several large-scale studies have probed the extent to which PDZ domains interact with phospholipids. An early study by Wu et al. (2007a) surveyed 74 human PDZ domains for their ability to bind PIPs in vitro and found that w25% of PDZ domains were capable of these interactions. Using a cell-based assay, Ivarsson et al., (2011 Ivarsson et al., ( , 2013 identified one Drosophila PDZ domain and 53 out of 256 (w22%) human PDZ domains as capable of interacting with PIPs. These observations were followed with biochemical validation and mutagenesis, reiterating the point that PDZ/PIP interactions are diverse and generally do not share a common motif. A more recent study combined surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and bioinformatics to predict the lipid-binding capacity of PDZ domains at a genomic level . The authors showed that nearly 40% of the 70 mouse, rat, and human PDZ domains bound to PIP molecules presented in anionic lipid vesicles. These PDZ domains were then used to develop an algorithm that included amino acid sequence and physiochemical information to predict PDZ/PIP interactions of 2000 PDZ domains found in 20 species. Validation of the PDZ/PIP interactions indicated that w90% of the predictions were correct, suggesting that nearly 30% of all PDZ domains bind PIPs. Finally, the authors developed a general classification scheme based on the proximity of the predicted lipidbinding site to the canonical C-terminal peptideebinding groove. Similar to other studies, it was found that PIP binding could influence peptide binding depending on the extent of overlap between the two binding sites.Cholesterol, another major lipid component of the cell plasma membrane, was also found to bind PDZ domains. A recent study used an SPR assay to screen PDZ domains that bind cholesterol . Of the 30 PDZ domains investigated, 12 were found to bind cholesterol with an affinity of mM or better. Using NHERF-1 PDZ1 domain as a model system, a cholesterol-binding motif was identified near the b2eb3 loop and b3 strand region of the PDZ surface, away from the canonical peptide-binding site. This motif contains a consensus recognition sequence, LeueXeXe TyreXeArg, where X represents any amino acid (Fig. 6D ). This consensusbinding motif might be useful for identifying additional cholesterol-binding PDZ domains. Functionally, the cholesterol-binding capacity of the NHERF-1 PDZ domain affected the Cl \\u00c0 channel activity of CFTR, a known binding partner. In particular, mutations that disrupted cholesterol binding also interfered with the membrane association of NHERF-1 and colocalization with CFTR, leading to a pronounced reduction in CFTRmediated current. More recently, Dvl2 was found to bind cholesterol, and this interaction was essential for activation of the canonical Wnt-signaling pathway (Sheng et al., 2014) .In summary, progress has been made in the field of the PDZ/lipid interaction. Several large-scale studies indicate phospholipid binding as a relatively common feature of PDZ domains. Functional analyses showed that phospholipid binding can have a major role on regulating canonical PDZ-domain interactions, and thus the activity of PDZ proteins. Furthermore, biochemical and structural studies revealed diverse phospholipidbinding sites on PDZ surfaces suggesting structural diversity in PDZ/PIP interactions (Gallardo et al., 2010) . Despite the first PDZ/PIP interaction being identified more than a decade ago, these interactions and their functional significance are still poorly understood. Given that only one PDZ/PIP co-complex structure has been determined to date, how phospholipid binding affects ligand binding is still not clear. Future investigations should focus on the detailed structural characterization of PDZ/phospholipid interactions and the functional interplay between peptide and lipid binding. Likewise, a few initial studies indicate that cholesterol binding to PDZ domains can be important, but the extent to which they occur, their precise binding site, and their physiological role(s) will require additional studies.\\n\\nINHIBITION OF PDZ DOMAIN/LIGAND INTERACTIONS\\n\\nThere have been many efforts placed on developing inhibitors targeting proteineprotein interactions involved in disease-related cellular signaling. We have already described many PDZ domain interactions that serve significant biologically roles in cellular signaling and whose dysfunction leads to various malignancies including neuronal toxicity, neuropathic pain, cancers, and CF (see Section 2). Moreover, biophysical and biochemical properties of PDZ domainemediated proteineprotein interactions have been very well characterized. Although PDZ domains share similar modes of ligand binding, their unique subcellular compartmentalization and tightly regulated complex assembly potentially make them selective for targeting, avoiding severe side effects of other common large protein families (e.g., GPCR and kinases). Hence, PDZ domains have emerged as important \\\"druggable\\\" targets (Blazer and Neubig, 2009; Dev, 2004; Gardiol, 2012; Grillo-Bosch et al., 2013; Manzo-Merino et al., 2013; Romero et al., 2011) . A further incentive for targeting PDZmediated interactions is that small molecule inhibitors might be developed that could overcome the permeability, bioavailability, and high cost associated with monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, nonclinical grade inhibitors can be employed as powerful probes to dissect the specificity of PDZdependent signaling cascades (Zhang et al., 2011b) . Below, we describe several PDZ-domain inhibitors identified as potential lead compounds for the treatment of a variety of conditions, including neuropathic pain, cancer, and CF.\\n\\nPDZ Domain Inhibitors in Neuronal Disorders\\n\\nAs described in previous sections, many synaptic junctional complexes are assembled through PDZ-mediated interactions and thus critical for synaptic formation and plasticity ( Fig. 2A) . One of most important PDZ-containing proteins is PSD-95. The first two PDZ domains from PSD-95 (PDZ1 and PDZ2) bind to NMDAR and nNOS to form an NMDAR/PSD-95/nNOS ternary complex Sattler et al., 1999) . Thus, PSD-95 PDZ1 and PDZ2 couple NMDAR signaling to nNOS and NO production. Importantly, overproduction of NO leads to neurotoxicity and ischemic brain damage (Huang et al., 1994) , results in the elevation of sensitivity associated with the central nervous system (central sensitivity), and promotes acute thermal hyperalgesia, a well-known inflammatory response that leads to pain sensitivity from thermal stimuli ( Ji and Strichartz, 2004) . Decreasing PSD-95 expression by an antisense oligonucleotide was able to suppress neurotoxicity without affecting NMDAR activity (Sattler et al., 1999) making PSD-95 an attractive target for inhibitor for development to treat stroke and systemic neuropathic pain. Initial efforts by the Tymianski group used a natural C-terminal PDZ ligand as antagonist to disrupt PSD-95/NMDAR signaling in vivo (Aarts et al., 2002) . A nonapeptide derived from the C-terminus of the NR2B subunit of the NMDAR (KLSSIESDV coo-, NR2B9c) was fused to the cell-membrane transduction domain of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein to form a Tat-peptide fusion (Tat-NR2B9c). Adding Tat-NR2B9c into cultured cortical neurons suppressed NO production by disrupting the PSD-95/NMDAR/nNOS ternary complex formation without affecting NMDAR activity. Furthermore, intraperitoneal injection of Tat-NR2B9c into mice showed pronounced effects in reducing ischemic neuronal damage after stroke onset. Although there are many other PDZ domaine containing proteins that participate in neuronal signaling cascades, Tat-NR2B9c perturbed the NMDAR/PSD-95 interaction with strikingly high specificity (Cui et al., 2007) . Therefore, this inhibitory peptide was effective in reducing stroke damage in mice without deleterious side effects that generally occur after blocking NMDAR. Indeed, this inhibitor peptide successfully provided neuroprotection in higher-order gyrencephalic primates on stroke, suggesting that it might be a useful therapeutic in humans (Cook et al., 2012a,b) . The Tat-NR2B9c peptide is being developed as a drug (NA-1) by NoNO Inc. (Toronto, Canada) to treat acute ischemic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and procedurally induced strokes. Importantly, it has already advanced through Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in the United States and Canada (http://nonoinc.ca/). The Phase 2 study clearly showed that NA-1 could reduce ischemic brain damage in patients (Hill et al., 2012) . A recent study found that NA-1 was also capable of reducing neonatal stoke damage and an effective neuroprotection regent in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (Xu et al., 2016) .The Str\\u00f8mgaard group has taken a similar approach, but with optimization of the Tat-NR2B9c peptide to avoid poor pharmacokinetics and stability issues. Initial truncation and mutational studies showed that the C-terminal five residues of the NR2B subunit (IESDV coo-) is the minimal peptide required to maintain high affinity (Bach et al., 2008) . As PSD-95 PDZ1 and PDZ2 are both capable of binding the IESDV coo-peptide, a dimeric Tat-fused peptide inhibitor linked by four polyethylene glycol (PEG4) subunits was developed to simultaneously target both PDZ domains (Bach et al., 2012) . The combination of the two PDZ ligands (i.e., multivalency) had a synergetic effect on affinity, creating a new ligand with w1000-fold greater affinity (K d w5 nM) than the Tat-NR2B9c ligand. Substitution of the central oxygen in the PEG4 linker with nitrogen (NPEG) [Tat-NPEG4(IETDV) 2 or Tat-N-dimer] showed an almost five fold enhancement in stability (T 1/2 w4900 m) compared with the monomeric Tat-NR2B9c (T 1/2 w1100 m) in human blood plasma. Moreover, modifying this peptide with a Tat peptide synthesized from D-amino acids (ReTat-N-dimeric) showed no sign of degradation in plasma. As proof of principle, the Tat-N-dimer inhibitor was capable of reducing ischemic brain damage by 40% in a mouse stroke model. Currently, this is the most efficient PSD-95 antagonist and a promising therapeutic agent against stroke (Avilex Pharma has been formed to develop these compounds, http://www.avilexpharma.com/). Because other types of acute brain injury, such as traumatic brain injury, share similar pathophysiological mechanisms as stroke, the efficacy of the dimer inhibitor was tested in animals with traumatic brain injury. However, no neuroprotective effect by this inhibitor was found in two recent studies using different animal models of traumatic brain injury (Sommer et al., 2017a; Sommer et al., 2017b,c) .Peptidomimetics, chemically modified natural peptides, are alternative peptide-like inhibitors designed to be more stable in vivo and have an increased affinity for PDZ domains. Modification of Tat-NR2B9c by truncation and methylation of the glutamate in the peptide (E Me TAV coo-) resulted in a chemically smaller inhibitor with essentially the same affinity as the parent IESDV coo-peptide. Additional optimization identified that an N-terminal chemical substitution of the peptide (N-cyclohexylethyl-ETAV coo-) had a w20-fold increase in affinity compared with the WT peptide (Bach et al., 2008) . In many cases, an additional advantage of peptidomimetics is enhanced stability against proteases, often achieved by peptide cyclization. The first example of this strategy for a PDZ domain was applied to the interaction between the PSD-95 PDZ3 domain and the CRIPT peptide. A cyclic peptide was synthesized by linking the P -1 and P -3 amino acids in the CRIPT peptide with b-alanine, which enhanced the affinity up to 10-fold. In addition, peptide cyclization promoted rapid onset and duration of inhibition in cellular assays due to an increased stability against proteases (Piserchio et al., 2004) . Several constrained cyclic peptides were designed to reduce the entropic changes on binding compared with linear peptides. In general, these cyclic peptides were capable of binding to the PSD-95 PDZ1 domain with high affinity (Udugamasooriya and Spaller, 2008) . Incorporation of a (Arg) 7 N-terminal extension to this peptidomimetic resulted in cell-permeable compounds. The cyclic peptide CN2097 (R7-CC-YK[KTE(b-Ala)]V) showed decreased hyperexcitability of neurons and alleviated thermal hyperalgesia in rats (LeBlanc et al., 2010) .The molecular weight and polarity features of peptides are potential drawbacks as inhibitors for use in vivo. In particular, short half-lives in the blood stream, excretion by human body, and poor transportation through cell membranes and the bloodebrain barrier limit their applicability. Peptidomimetics might overcome some of these liabilities, but they are still relatively large. In contrast, small molecule inhibitors in principle do not have these limitations and have their own benefits, in particular displaying higher stability in cells and blood plasma (Wang et al., 2008) . To date, many small molecule inhibitors have been developed to target neuronal PDZ domains (see Fig. 7 and Table 2 ). Two indole-based compounds, ZL006 and IC87201, were identified that target the PSD-95 PDZ2/ nNOS interaction using in silico docking and high-throughput methods, respectively. Both compounds readily crossed the bloodebrain barrier and inhibited the PSD-95 PDZ2/nNOS interaction effectively, with IC 50 s of 82 nM and 31 mM, respectively. ZL006 showed neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia in rats (Zhou et al., 2010) , whereas IC87201 suppressed mechanical allodynia (i.e., neuropathic pain caused by innocuous stimuli) induced by chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve ( Fig. 7A.1 and A. 2) (Florio et al., 2009) . Neither of the compounds interfered with normal NMDAR or nNOS function and showed no major side effects. However, a recent study employed a battery of biochemical methods, yet failed to validate the direct interaction between either of these compounds and the PDZ domains in PSD-95 or nNOS (Bach et al., 2015) . Thus, further mechanistic studies will be required to understand the precise molecular mechanism of action of ZL006 and IC87201. Several other indole-based compounds were identified and optimized by in silico docking and solution NMR methods to target the PSD-95 PDZ1/5-HT 2A serotonin receptor interaction (Boucherle et al., 2011) . One particular analogue (8b) was effective at suppressing the mechanical hyperalgesia in a rat model of neuropathic pain (Fig. 7A .3) (Boucherle et al., 2011; Vogrig et al., 2013) .Other PDZ-containing proteins associated with synapses are potential targets for inhibition. For example, the PICK-1 and Shank-3 have roles in chronic pain, autism spectrum disorders, and schizophrenia (see in Section 2). Among these, the PICK-1 PDZ domain has been shown to be involved in cocaine-induced plasticity, neuronal toxicity after cerebral trauma, and neuropathic pain (Bell et al., 2009; Bellone and Luscher, 2006; Garry et al., 2003) . Consequently, the PICK-1 PDZ domain has been targeted for the development of small molecule inhibitors. A recent study developed a FP-based assay using a dye-labeled C-terminal peptide from the dopamine transporter (DAT) to identify inhibitors that disrupt PICK-1 PDZ interactions (Thorsen et al., 2010 (Thorsen et al., , 2011 . The assay was optimized on a 96-well microtiter plate format and used to screen a 43,380 compound library from Neurosearch A/S (Denmark). Six chemically distinct compounds with affinities ranging from w5 to 200 mM were characterized, and the compounds FSC231 and CSC-03 were chosen for further study (Fig. 7A.4 and A.5) . Competition-binding experiments determined that FSC231 had a K i w10 mM, similar to that found for the DAT peptide. Moreover, this compound was selective and did not disrupt three other PDZ/ligand interactions. Bioactivity studies showed that FSC231 was capable of passing the cell membrane and blocking PICK-1 PDZ in COS7 cells. Importantly, FSC231 blocked both LTD and LTP in hippocampal CA1 neurons, consistent with the inhibition of PICK-1 function in synaptic plasticity (Thorsen et al., 2010) . These results suggest that FSC231 is a promising lead compound for the development of smallmolecule therapeutics to treat PICK-1eassociated conditions such as neuropathic pain, excitotoxicity, and cocaine addiction.Inhibitors targeting Shank-3 PDZ domain interactions were also identified by high throughput screening (HTS) methods. Using an FP-based 384-well format, two compounds containing a tetrahydroquinoline chemical scaffold (K i s w10 mM) were identified from the ChemBioNet library (Saupe et al., 2011) . Structure activity relationship (SAR) studies identified two additional potent compounds. In addition, the X-ray crystal structure of Shank-3 PDZ complexed with compound 36 (a quinoline derivative) was determined (Saupe et al., 2011) (Fig. 7A.6 and B) . The crystal structure provided valuable insight into PDZ/inhibitor interactions; in particular, it showed that the carboxylate at position R 6 is critical for binding. Unfortunately, no cell-based or in vivo studies were performed, and thus the biological efficacy of these compounds remains unknown.\\n\\nPDZ Domain Inhibitors in Cancer\\n\\nA variety of PDZ proteins and their interactions are crucial for the regulation of cell polarity, development, and proliferation. Dysfunction in the control of these processes, either by loss or inappropriate activation of PDZ proteins, has been found in several human malignancies, including cancer. In some specific cases, PDZ domain interactions are potential targets for the development of inhibitors and offer therapeutic value for the treatment of cancer (Subbaiah et al., 2011) . The best-studied example is the Dvl protein, which contains a single PDZ domain. The Dvl PDZ domain interacts with the Frizzled receptor and is involved in Wnt signaling that activates transcription of many oncogenic genes, such as Myc and Cyclin D1 (MacDonald et al., 2009) . Moreover, inappropriate activation of Wnt signaling by upregulation of Dvl has been implicated in tumorigenesis of breast, colon, prostate, leukemia, and lung cancer, whereas downregulation of Dvl inhibited tumor growth (Bui et al., 1997; Mizutani et al., 2005; Uematsu et al., 2003a Uematsu et al., , 2003b . Thus, inhibiting Dvl and its PDZ domainemediated interaction could have significant therapeutic value for the treatment of cancer.Using a structure-based in silico screening approach, Zheng and colleagues identified several small molecules from the National Cancer Institute 3D structure database as potential inhibitors (Shan et al., 2005) . NMR-based experiments showed that NSC668036 bound to the Dvl PDZ domain, whereas competition-binding experiments estimated the affinity for this PDZ domain to be w237 mM. The NSC668036 compound was bound to the Dvl PDZ domain specifically, as no binding was observed with either PSD-95 PDZ1 or GRIP-1 PDZ7 domains. Importantly, in vivo signaling assays in Xenopus embryos showed that NSC668036 blocked canonical Wnt signaling at the Dvl level. Subsequent screens using a refined docking algorithm and multiple libraries (NCI, Chemical Diversity and Sigmae Aldrich) identified additional compounds with higher affinity (Grandy et al., 2009) . In particular, the compound 3289e8625 was found to bind the canonical Dvl PDZ domainebinding pocket with a dissociation constant of w11 mM (Fig. 7A.7) . This compound was biologically active as it inhibited Wnt signaling in Xenopus embryos and suppressed the proliferation of prostate cancerederived PC-3 cells. Independently, Fujii et al. (2007c) identified the compound FJ9 using an AlphaScreen assay developed for the Dvl PDZ/Frz receptor interactions. This compound contained an indole-2-carbinol scaffold (Fig. 7A.8) and bound the Dvl PDZ domain directly. FJ9 was able to suppress canonical Wnt signaling and cell growth in both melanoma and nonesmall cell lung cancer cell lines. Finally, FJ9 had a marked inhibition of tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. Together, the development and use of Dvl PDZ inhibitors directly show that inhibition of Dvl PDZ interactions is linked to tumor growth in distinct model biological systems, providing several lead compounds for further development as cancer therapeutics.Subsequent studies used more sophisticated computational tools to guide the design and synthesis of new potent inhibitors for the hit-to-lead stage of drug development. In particular, the use of a computational pharmacophore model for the NSC668036 inhibitor and additional in silico searching identified 15 related compounds with w6e28-fold tighter affinity for the Dvl PDZ domain . Additional virtual screening with a higher diversity of substituents yielded nine more related compounds (Shan et al., 2012) . These compounds were then used to develop threedimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) profile. Guided by the 3D-QSAR profile and using \\\"compound 16\\\" as a reference, several novel compounds were designed, synthesized, and tested for binding to the Dvl PDZ domain. The compound J01-017a (Fig. 7A.9 ) emerged from the pool of optimized compounds as having the highest affinity (K d w1.5 mM) of any compound for the Dvl PDZ domain to date. This compound is currently being tested for biological activity. Concurrently, the known anti-inflammatory drug Sulindac was identified to interact with Dvl PDZ domain and block canonical Wnt signaling in Xenopus embryos (Fig. 7A .10) . The solution NMR structure of the complex showed that the carboxylic acid group in Sulindac forms hydrogen bonds with the PDZ carboxylic-binding loop (Fig. 7B ). In addition, the oxygen atom in the (methylsulfinyl)benzene ring of Sulindac interacted with a unique Arg residue (Arg322) side chain in a2 helix of Dvl PDZ. The structure explained the observed specificity of Sulindac as it did not bind three other PDZ domains. Thus, Sulindac is a good example of a \\\"repurposed\\\" drug with novel therapeutic value.The PDZ-containing proteins GIPC-1, PTPN-4, syntenin, AF-6, and MAGI-1 are involved in tumorigenesis and potential targets for inhibitor development. GIPC-1 contains a single PDZ domain that interacts with the C-termini of transmembrane receptors (e.g., insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 or IGF-1R) and cytosolic proteins (e.g., the regulator of G-protein signaling 19 or RGS19). It is upregulated in breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers and promotes tumor proliferation and invasion (Muders et al., 2006 (Muders et al., , 2009 Rudchenko et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2010b) . This is due in part to the role of GIPC-1 in endosomal trafficking and stabilization of IGF-1R at the cell surface. Knockdown of GIPC-1 in cancer cells inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis through the function of the PDZ domain, suggesting that inhibition of this domain may be a novel target for therapeutic development (Chittenden et al., 2010; Muders et al., 2006) . To this end, Mukhopadhyay and colleagues used an N-terminally myristoylated octapeptide derived from the C-terminus of RGS19 (N-myristoyl-PSQSSSEA coo-or CR1023) to disrupt the GIPC-1 PDZ domain interactions in cells to inhibit proliferation, survival (Muders et al., 2009) , and tumor growth in vivo (Wang et al., 2010b) . Modification of CR1023 at P -1 and P -3 with the bromobenzoyl group into the amine sidechains of Lys yielded the peptidomimetic inhibitor CR1166 [N-myristoyl-PSQSK(N-4-bromobenzoyl)SK(N-4-bromobenzoyl)A coo-], which had the greatest biological activity cells and in vivo, significantly reducing both breast and pancreatic tumor growth in mice (Patra et al., 2012) .The human protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 4 (PTPN4) promotes tumorigenesis by protecting cancer cells against death. PTPN4 contains a single PDZ domain and its interaction with the C-terminus of the envelope glycoprotein (G) of the rabies virus is a critical determinant of virulence. Importantly, the wild-type envelope glycoprotein (G) PBM does not bind the PTPN4 PDZ domain, allowing both cell survival and virulence. In contrast, a single mutation in the envelope protein G (GETRL coo-to GQTRL coo-) permits the interaction of the PTPN4 PDZ domain and leads to cellular apoptosis and attenuation of virulence (Prehaud et al., 2010) . Based on these observations, Wolff and colleagues devised a therapeutic strategy to induce apoptosis in malignant brain tumors, such as glioblastoma, using peptides that target the PTPN4 PDZ domain (Babault et al., 2011) . Guided by the crystal structures of two PTPN4 PDZ domain complexes (with Cyto13-att: GETRL coo-and GluN2A16: ISEDVcoo-), a series of peptides with a broad range of affinity were designed by incorporating positively and negatively charged residues at P -4 and P -1 , respectively. This optimized peptide was fused to a HIV-1 Tat peptide to aid in cell permeability (Tat-RETEV coo-) and showed w150-fold enhancement in affinity in vitro. Moreover, it induced apoptosis in w70% of cells of a highly invasive glioblastoma cell line, which exceeded the effectiveness of Shepherdin, an established compound that induces apoptosis (Plescia et al., 2005) . Therefore, this newly engineered peptide might be an efficient antiproliferative agent for malignant glioblastoma.The protein syntenin1 contains two PDZ domains that have recently been found to play central roles in tumor invasion and angiogenesis. Different binding partners as well as downstream regulators of syntenin1 PDZ domains, including Src kinase, MAPK, and focal adhesion kinase, have been identified that promote the progression and invasion of a variety of cancers, including breast cancer, melanoma, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Kegelman et al., 2015) . Radiotherapy is a common treatment for GBM. However, cells surviving radiotherapy had increased invasiveness mediated by syntenin1 PDZ domain interactions. Thus, inhibiting syntenin1 PDZ domain interactions might complement radiotherapy. Combining fragment-based screening by NMR with in silico docking identified a small molecule (113B7) that specifically interacted mostly with the PDZ1 domain and part of the PDZ1e PDZ2 interface of syntenin1 (Fig. 7A.11) . Moreover, it did not bind to the isolated syntenin1 PDZ2 domain. This example suggests that tandem PDZ domains might have additional specificity compared with individual domains. Cellular studies found that 113B7 inhibited cell invasion mediated by synte-nin1, similar to the effect of syntenin1 knockdown. In a GBM animal model, 113B7 treated mice had increased survival. The combination of 113B7 with radiotherapy produced significant effects in decreasing GBM invasion and enhanced survival. Together, these data suggest that an effective PDZ inhibitor can complement traditional radiotherapy to combat aggressive cancers, such as GBM (Kegelman et al., 2017) .Acute lymphoid leukemia fusion partner on chromosome 6 (AF-6, afadin, or MLLT4) was originally identified as a fusion partner of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene involved in lymphoblastic and myeloid acute leukemia. AF-6 contains two Ras-associated domains and a single PDZ domain (Mandai et al., 2013) . The PDZ domain binds the C-terminus of several target proteins, including transmembrane adhesion receptors (e.g., NRXN and nectin) and kinases (e.g., Eph receptors and Bcr). The interaction with Bcr is important for regulating Ras signaling, cellecell junctions, and oncogenic potential (Liedtke et al., 2010; Radziwill et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005) . Thus, the AF-6 PDZ domain may be a useful target for inhibitor development. The initial efforts for identifying small molecule inhibitors targeting the AF-6 PDZ domain used an NMR spectroscopy approach for identifying lead compounds and medicinal chemistry for lead optimization. A small library of 5000 compounds was screened using 15 N-labeled PDZ domain and 2D 1 He 15 N-heteronuclear single quantum correlation experiments to identify weakly binding compounds. This screen led to three classes of compounds, including one containing a thiazolidinone scaffold with a K d w460 mM. A secondary screen of analogues verified the importance of several functional groups. Additional SAR studies identified that a trifluoromethyl phenyl ring (4-CF 3 C 6 H 4 ) appended to the thiazolidinone scaffold (compound 5f) improved the affinity for the AF-6 PDZ to K d w100 mM (Fig. 7A.12) . The solution structure of the complex indicated that the trifluoromethyl phenyl ring bound deeply into the hydrophobic peptide-binding groove ( Joshi et al., 2006) . Unfortunately, this compound did not have high binding specificity, as it also bound to the a1-syntrophin PDZ domain. More recently, these same authors reported a study aimed at developing compounds based on the 5f scaffold with higher affinity and specificity (Vargas et al., 2014) . Modification at position R 6 improved the affinity and specificity of the parent compound. Compound 10, containing a morpholine-phenylcarbonylmethyl moiety, had the highest affinity (K d w4.9 mM) for the AF-6 PDZ domain and did not bind to the Shank-3 or PSD-95 PDZ1 and PDZ3 domains, but showed weak binding to the Dvl1, PSD-95 PDZ2, and a1-syntrophin PDZ domains. NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments and molecular modeling indicated that compound 10 bound in the same peptide groove as the parent compound, but extended into a new subpocket (Ala80 pocket). The series of compounds were capable of disrupting the AF-6/Bcr interaction in cells, suppressing RTK/Ras signaling and maintaining the cells in the nonproliferative state. Further development of these compounds may have potential value in the treatment of leukemia.Membrane-associated guanylate kinase with an inverted repeat family proteins (MAGI 1e3) are atypical members of the MAGUK superfamily located at tight junctions and regulators of cellular trafficking (Laura et al., 2002) . MAGI proteins have important functions in regulating cellecell contacts and stabilizing target proteins (e.g., AMPARs) at the membrane. Importantly, MAGI proteins have been implicated in cancer through their interactions with the PTEN tumor suppressor and HPV-16 and -18 E6 viral proteins (Feng et al., 2014) . In particular, the interaction between PDZ2 of MAGI-2 and -3 with PTEN suppresses AKT kinase signaling and apoptosis (Tolkacheva et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2000) . In contrast, the first PDZ domain of all MAGIs was found to be a cellular target of HPV-16 and -18 E6 PBMs, and the interaction resulted in MAGI-1 degradation, subsequent loss of cellecell junction integrity, and the progression of human cervical carcinomas Thomas et al., 2001) . Thus, several groups have begun campaigns to identify small-molecule probes to further understand the role of MAGI proteins in PTEN signaling and inhibit their interaction with HPV proteins.Inhibition of MAGI-3 PDZ2 was first attempted using an in silico docking approach. A homology model of the MAGI-3 PDZ2 with a C-terminal PTEN peptide was constructed and a variety of heterocyclic core structures were docked into the peptide-binding site. This docking approach found that an indole-3-carbinol chemical scaffold could preserve the required geometry and distance to support an interaction with the PDZ domain, whereas still accessing a critical histidine residue located in the a1 helix to produce a covalent bond (Fujii et al., 2007a) . This compound was active in cells showing w3-fold decrease in AKT signaling (Fujii et al., 2003) . Moving the 3-hydroxymethyl to another position produced an indole-2carbinol scaffold, which acted as a reversible inhibitor for MAGI-3 PDZ domain. This compound is similar to the FJ9 scaffold mentioned above (see Fig. 7A .8) (Fujii et al., 2007b ). An SPR-based HTS was recently developed to discover potential inhibitors targeting the MAGI-1 PDZ1/HPV-16 E6 interaction (Choulier et al., 2013) . In this assay, a C-terminal HPV-16 E6 peptide was covalently attached to the sensor chip and the PDZ domain with and without compound flowed over the chip. Screening 1120 compounds Prestwick Chemical Library (France) yielded four inhibitors with IC 50 s estimated to be between 10 and 50 mM. Interestingly, one compound (methacycline hydrochloride) was found to bind the peptide rather than the PDZ domain, whereas the other three compounds bound to the MAGI-1 PDZ1 domain. No cell-based assays were performed, and hence the potential therapeutic value of these compounds is unknown.\\n\\nPDZ Domain Inhibitors in Cystic Fibrosis\\n\\nAs mentioned in Section 2, CF is caused by a variety of CFTR mutations. The most common disease-causing mutation, DF508 CFTR (a deletion of residue F508), results in inefficient folding of the protein, rapid degradation, and decreased channel activity (Guggino and Stanton, 2006) . The decreased CFTR function impairs transportation of ions across the epithelial membrane and causes the accumulation of thick viscous mucus in the lungs that blocks the airway (Riordan, 2008) . Several inhibitors have been developed to target CFTR for the treatment of CF. These compounds are either \\\"correctors\\\" (Pedemonte et al., 2005) or \\\"potentiators\\\" (Van Goor et al., 2006) capable of correcting the folding of DF508 CFTR or potentiating ion flow through the channel, respectively. However, these modulators are still not capable of rescuing DF508 CFTR activity to wild-type levels. This, in part, is due to the rapid degradation of DF508 CFTR mediated by the interaction of the CFTR PBM with the CAL PDZ protein (Cheng et al., 2002; Lukacs et al., 1993; Swiatecka-Urban et al., 2005) . Inhibition of CAL (and CAL PDZ interactions) by RNA interference or mutation of the CAL PDZ domain resulted in an increase in DF508 CFTR cell-surface expression, suggesting that CAL PDZ/CFTR PBM inhibition is a viable strategy to treat CF, particularly in the presence of other therapeutic corrector and potentiator compounds (Cushing et al., 2008; Wolde et al., 2007) .To identify and engineer potent peptide inhibitors of CAL PDZ domain interactions, Boisguerin and colleagues screened a library of C-terminal peptides for high-affinity ligands . After several rounds of optimization, a decameric peptide inhibitor, iCAL36 10 (ANSRWPTSII coo-) was obtained with a K i of 17 mM for the CAL PDZ and little affinity (K i > 1 mM) for the NHERF-1 and -2 PDZ domains (two PDZ proteins known to interact with the CFTR PBM). Further N-terminally modification of iCAL36 10 with fluorescein (F *-iCAL36 10 ) improved the affinity (K i w1.3 mM) for the CAL PDZ domain and rendered the peptide cell permeable. In cells, the F*-iCAL36 10 peptide blocked CAL PDZ-domain interactions, increased the half-life of DF508 CFTR at the cell surface, and enhanced current efflux . A series of peptide inhibitors were designed using the structurebased computational design algorithm (known as K*) (Roberts et al., 2012) and the solution structure of the CAL PDZ/CFTR PBM (Piserchio et al., 2005) . Among the top scoring designs, the hexapeptide kCAL01 (WQVTRV coo-) was found to have highest affinity (K i w2.3 mM), comparable to the iCAL36 10 peptide. This newly designed peptide had similar efficiency as F *-iCAL36 10 in restoring DF508 CFTR cell-membrane expression and Cl \\u00c0 efflux in CF patientederived bronchial cells. The recent crystal structure of the CAL PDZ/iCAL36 10 complex coupled with mutagenesis was able to rationalize the iCAL36 10 design (Amacher et al., 2013 (Amacher et al., , 2014a .The use of inorganic metals and chemical modifications of iCAL36 10 peptide derivatives was explored to enhance the affinity to the CAL PDZ domain. Incorporating rhodium (II) tetracarboxylate [Rh 2 (OAc) 4 ] into the Glu at P -6 of the peptide yielded the E Rh WPTSII coo-metallopeptide. This metallopeptide complex was bound to the CAL PDZ domain with an affinity of 0.56 mM, a 75-fold increase in binding compared to the unmodified peptide. This increase was accomplished through a direct interaction with His301 of CAL PDZ and the metal, as the H301A mutation decreased the affinity significantly compared to CAL PDZ WT (Kundu et al., 2012) . In a separate study, the the role of individual residues in the iCAL36 10 peptide for PDZ binding was probed by incorporating a substituted N z -lysine (e.g., acetylation or halogenated benzoic acid) as chemical modifications (Amacher et al., 2014b) . However, these modifications generally had small effects on peptide affinity. Together, these studies have explored a large chemical space and provides an excellent template for the development of future peptidomimetic inhibitors.NHERF-1 and -2 are PDZ-containing proteins that interact with and stabilize CFTR activity at the membrane (Raghuram et al., 2001) . The NHERF-2 PDZ1 domain also binds to the C-terminus of LPA2. This interaction initiates the G i proteinesignaling pathway, which inhibits adenylate cyclase effectively reducing the local cAMP concentration to ultimately downregulate CFTR activity. Thus, the NHERF-1/2 PDZ domain is another potential target for inhibition to rescue the CFTR function (Fig. 2E) . A structure-based in silico design was first performed using the indole-3-carbinol inhibitor, identified for MAGI-3 PDZ2 domain (Fujii et al., 2007b) . Unique chemical moieties were added or replaced at specific positions of this scaffold to generate diverse analogues targeting the NHERF-1 PDZ domain. In particular, replacing the methyl group at P -3 pocket with carboxyl acid improved the potency possibly by mimicking the favorable salt bridge between P -3 Asp and PDZ Arg40. Similarly, the indole-2-carbinolebased inhibitor prevented the covalent bonding with the PDZ domain to work as a reversible inhibitor (see Fig. 7A .8) (Fujii et al., 2007a) . Another inhibitor, CO-068, targeting the NHERF-2 PDZ domain was successfully discovered using AlphaScreen-based HTS (Zhang et al., 2011b) (Fig. 7A.13 ). This compound displayed an inhibitory effect against NHERF-2 PDZ/LPA2 peptide with IC 50 w60 mM. In contrast, the IC 50 of CO-068 for both the NHERF-1 PDZ/CFTR and NHERF-2 PDZ/CFTR interactions was greater than 120 mM, suggesting high specificity for the target complex. CO-068 disrupted the NHERF-2 PDZ/LPA2 interaction in cells without affecting the NHERF-2 PDZ/CFTR interaction, and the treated cells had increased cAMP levels and CFTR channel function. This same study used a pig tracheal submucosal gland secretion model to show that compound CO-068 potentiates CFTR-dependent fluid secretion. These data suggest that CO-068 could restore the decreased CFTR activity and ultimately the impaired airway clearance in CF patients. More potent compounds could be further developed using the current chemical scaffold for use as a therapeutic reagent for CF.As described above, a number of PDZ domains have been successfully targeted by small molecules or peptides for therapeutic benefit. These successes provide the impetus for continued development of novel inhibitors. However, challenges remain. First, the robustness of inhibition of relatively weak PDZ domain interactions for therapeutic benefit remains an open question for many of the systems studied. However, the inhibitors that simultaneously targeted the PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains of PSD-95 suggest that increasing affinity using multi-valency can result in suitably robust compounds (Bach et al., 2012) . Second, the specificity of targeting PDZ domain interactions still has not been fully validated. Given that there are hundreds of PDZ domains in the human genome, the possibility of nonspecific targeting could be a real issue that requires additional studies to resolve. However, targeting lager fragments containing multiple PDZ domains, rather than an isolated PDZ domain, might provide the required specificity. Syntenin is a good example of this, where the 113B7 inhibitor targeted PDZ1 and the linker between PDZ1 and PDZ2, but not PDZ2 (Kegelman et al., 2017) . This example suggests that the interfaces between PDZ domains and their adjacent domains might provide greater specificity than the isolated PDZ domain. Thus, PDZ domains in the context of larger fragments likely contain unique environments that might be exploited to obtain greater inhibitor specificity. Thus, the verdict is still out on how effective targeting PDZ domain interactions will be for treating disease, but it is clear that the current developed probes have great utility for providing insight into the biology of a number of signal transduction systems and disease states.\\n\\nPhosphorylation\\n\\nPhosphorylation is a common mechanism used for the regulation of cellular signaling. There is now mounting literature about regulation of PDZ domain signaling by phosphorylation. Overall, phosphorylation was found in both PBMs and PDZ domains, and it can be positive or negative.\\n\\nPhosphorylation of the PDZ-Binding Motif\\n\\nResidues in the PBM often contain Ser, Thr, or Tyr amino acids that can be phosphorylated. Generally, phosphorylation disrupts PDZ/ligand interactions. For instance, a study showed that phosphorylation of serotonin 5-HT 2C receptor at either the P -1 or P -2 Ser disrupted the interaction with the MUPP-1 PDZ10 (Parker et al., 2003) . This result was quantified using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and showed w37or 26-fold decrease in affinity on phosphorylation of P -1 or P -2 Ser, respectively (Sharma et al., 2007) . The phosphorylation of the 5-HT 2C receptor at the P -1 Ser is a key mechanism for receptor resensitization (Backstrom et al., 2000) . Phosphorylation can also regulate internalization of receptors in synaptic transmission. For example, phosphorylation of the P -2 Ser in the PBM of the NR2b subunit of the NMDA receptor regulated the interaction between NR2b and PSD-95 or SAP-102. CaMKII and the CK2 complex drove NR2b phosphorylation and selectively removed this subunit from the cell surface and decreased surface expression of the receptor (Chung et al., 2004; Sanz-Clemente et al., 2013) . Phosphorylation also controlled endocytic sorting of the b2-adrenergic receptor by modulating the PDZ domain interaction (Cao et al., 1999) . Phosphorylation at P -3 Ser of the AMPAR GluR2 PBM prevented the interaction with GRIP-1 PDZ5, but not the PICK-1 PDZ domain (Chung et al., 2000) . Phosphorylation also regulated the AMPAR internalization, prevented its surface accumulation, depressed its signal transmission and affected LTD (Seidenman et al., 2003) .Phosphorylation has not only been seen in the PBMs of cell surface receptors but also in the PBMs of different virus proteins. HTLV-1 Tax-1 was phosphorylated by CK2 at P -2 Thr in the PBM. Moreover, this phosphorylation disrupted the interaction between Tax-1 PBM and hDlg PDZ, though the biological consequence of this interaction was not determined (Bidoia et al., 2010) . High-risk HPV E6 proteins were previously shown to interact with Dlg PDZ domain through their PBMs. This interaction normally induces degradation of Dlg. However, phosphorylation of the P -2 Thr in PBM disrupted this interaction and Dlg was no longer targeted for degradation (Kuhne et al., 2000) .A larger scale study using synthetic phosphorylated peptides library found that phosphorylation also disrupted ligand interactions with AF-6, Erbin, and a-1-syntrophin PDZ domains, with the greatest effect at the P -1 and P -2 positions (Boisguerin et al., 2007) . More recently, a study determined that 31/146 proteins that have a class I PBM and a potential phosphorylation site at P -1 position could be phosphorylated, reinforcing the idea that this position is important for PDZ/PBM regulation (Pangon et al., 2012) .Phosphorylation does not always disrupt PDZ/PBM interactions, and several cases show it can bolster PDZ/PBM binding. Phosphorylation of the P -2 Thr in the PTEN PBM disrupted the interactions with Dlg1 PDZ2 and MAST PDZ, but promoted the association with two other proteins yet to be identified (Adey et al., 2000) . PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the MRP2 (an ABC protein family member) PBM at P -3 Ser enhanced the binding to its cognate PDZ domains (Hegedus et al., 2003) . Likewise, P -3 Ser or Thr phosphorylation of C-termini of FATZ Z-discs protein family members (FATZ1: EpTEEL, FATZ2: EpSEDL, and FATZ3: EpSEEL) resulted in tighter binding to the ZASP/cypher PDZ domain compared the unphosphorylated form (von Nandelstadh et al., 2009) . Overall, phosphorylation modulates the PDZ/ligand interactome in both positive and negative manners.Despite all the biochemical and biological analyses on the phosphorylation of PDZ/PBM interactions, structural information remains scarce. Phosphorylation of P -7 Tyr (pTyr) in ErbB2 decreased the Erbin PDZ/ ErbB2-binding affinity almost three fold. The crystal structure of the Erbin PDZ/pErbB2 (containing pTyr) complex was solved. Interestingly, the structure failed to resolve the interactions as the electron density of residues beyond P -4 was not interpretable, implying that the weaker binding is connected to the conformational flexibility in this region (Birrane et al., 2003) . Another study found that pTyr had little effect on the ligand binding in the Tiam1 PDZ/syndecan-1 (SDC1) interaction. The phosphorylation of P -1 tyrosine (TKQEEFpYA) of SDC1 modestly increased the binding affinity from 27 to 19 mM (Shepherd et al., 2010) . The structure of Tiam1 PDZ complexed with SDC1 and phosphorylated SDC1 (pSDC1) revealed the molecular rationale for this result. Namely, phosphorylation of the Tyr side chain induced a conformational switch, flipping the Tyr side chain toward the K879 in S -1 pocket and facilitating an electrostatic interaction with a phosphate in pTyr (Fig. 8A) . Interestingly, this phosphorylation also regulated the protein dynamics by decoupling the allosteric b3-a1 site from ligand-binding site (see details in Section 5.2) (Liu et al., 2013) .As PBM phosphorylation can both enhance and suppress the binding with different PDZ domains, it could be a means for selecting particular PDZ/PBM interactions. Regulation of PDZ/ligand-binding events via phosphorylation and selection of specific PDZ interaction partners is best exemplified in the SDC1 and AMPAR systems (Fig. 8A ). Internalization of SDC1 was shown to be dependent on the syntenin-1 PDZ2/SDC1 interaction in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, whereby phosphorylation of SDC1 at Tyr P -1 prevented SDC1 internalization (Sulka et al., 2009) . A structural model of the syntenin1 PDZ2/pSDC1 structure suggested that two negatively charged residues (D204 and D224) in the S -1 pocket were likely electrostatically unfavorable, preventing the interaction with pTyr. Interestingly, these residues (or other acidic residues) were not found in the S -1 pocket of either GIPC or CASK PDZ domain. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that these PDZ domains might accommodate both the pSDC1 and SDC1 ligands. Thus, phosphorylation of P -1 Tyr might serve as a switch between activation of SDC1/Tiam1/Rac1 signaling and the SDC1 recycling pathway (Liu et al., 2013; Roper et al., 2012) . A phosphorylation-based switch was also found in AMPAR signaling. The C-terminus of GluR2 subunit of AMPAR is the ligand for the PICK-1 PDZ and GRIP-1 PDZ5 domains. As mentioned above, phosphorylation at the P -3 Ser residue selectively blocked the interaction with GRIP-1 but did not affect the interaction with the PICK-1 PDZ domain. Additionally, P -7 Tyr phosphorylation of the GluR2 subunit also regulated the PDZ binding. Likewise, this phosphorylation did not affect binding to the PICK-1 PDZ domain, whereas the GRIP-1 PDZ5 domain interaction was severely disrupted. Importantly, each phosphorylation event was able to selectively activate the PICK1-mediated cell surface receptor internalization pathway, which would induce internalization and loss of the surface pool of GluR2 Hayashi and Huganir, 2004) . It would be interesting to know the combined effect of P -3 Ser and P -7 Tyr phosphorylation, which has not been investigated.The extent to which differential regulation of PDZ/ligand interactions and pathways occurs is not clear because of the few cases reported in the literature. New high-throughput methods are needed to discover more phosphorylated ligands, and the context with which they occur. Furthermore, biochemical and structural investigations of these phosphorylation events will be necessary to understand the molecular origins of this regulation. These studies will be required for exploiting these interactions to enable rationale control PDZ domain interactions via protein engineering or small molecules.\\n\\nPhosphorylation of PDZ Domains\\n\\nPhosphorylation of PDZ domains that affect PBM interactions was first seen in SAP-97 and PSD-95. CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-73 in PSD-95 PDZ1 domain disrupted its interaction with the NR2A subunit from NMDAR (Mauceri et al., 2007) . Similarly, Ser phosphorylation was identified in NHERF-1 PDZ1 domain and shown to reduce the binding to both the b2-adrenergic receptor and CFTR (Voltz et al., 2007) . A recent study reported a comprehensive analysis of phosphorylation of four different sites on the three PDZ domains of PSD-95 (Pedersen et al., 2017) . These phosphorylation sites were identified in vivo, although the kinases responsible for modifying these sites have not been identified. The phosphorylation sites were produced by the \\\"expressed protein ligation\\\" method targeting a Ser residue (Ser-73) located in the b1eb2 loop, three Tyr residues in the b5 strand, the b5ea2 loop, and the additional a3 helix. The phosphorylated PDZ domains maintained their structure but were generally thermodynamic destabilized. Phosphorylation of these sites suppressed PBM binding, but to differing extents (up to 1.2e11-fold). Therefore, PDZ phosphorylation seems to regulate ligand binding by fine-tuning the interaction rather than acting as a binary on/off switch. Interestingly, a 4.5-fold enhancement of affinity was found with the stargazin ligand after phosphorylation of Tyr397 (pTyr397) in the atypical a3 helix of the PDZ3 domain, a region distal from the ligand-binding pocket. This was proposed to be mediated by salt bridges formed among two Arg residues (Arg 318 and 319) in stargazin and pTyr397 in PDZ3. However, pTyr397 also reduced the affinity between PDZ3 domain and other ligands, including the CRIPT ligand. The molecular mechanism of this result was reported in an NMR study and involved the rapid association and dissociation of the a3 helix to the core of PDZ3, resulting in a lowered affinity for CRIPT ligand (Zhang et al., 2011a) . Moreover, pTyr397 controls the interdomain packing between PDZ3 and the adjacent SH3 domain, an unprecedented role for phosphorylation in a PDZ-containing protein. Phosphorylation of a flanking region near a PDZ domain to regulate ligand binding was also found in the AF-6 PDZ protein. Here, phosphorylation of a threonine residue located 100 amino acids upstream of the PDZ domain impaired ligand binding (Radziwill et al., 2003) . The structural mechanism for this phosphorylation-based allosteric regulation is not clear, but likely occurs through protein dynamics and conformational change.The interplay between PDZ domain and PBM phosphorylation and phospholipid binding has also been seen. Phosphorylation of a C-terminal region of the syntenin1 PDZ domains was critical for high-affinity binding with phospholipids (Wawrzyniak et al., 2012) . The C-termini of many cell surface receptors contain PBMs, therefore phospholipid and PBM binding may be coincidental. Moreover, a recent study showed that in vitro phosphorylation of PICK-1 PDZ domain was enhanced w10-fold after adding lipids into the reaction. This implied that the recruitment of PDZ domain to the membrane was an important step for following kinase-mediated reaction (Ammendrup-Johnsen et al., 2012) .In summary, phosphorylation of PDZ domains can modulate their interaction with ligands both positively and negatively. This typically depends on the identity of the residues surrounding the phosphorylation site, which often contain charged side chains. In contrast to the PBM phosphorylation, the study of PDZ phosphorylation sites and consequences is underdeveloped, possibly owing to the challenges of obtaining phosphorylated PDZ domains. Phosphomimetic mutations, such as Asp and Glu residues, could be used, but they often do not represent authentic phosphorylation effectively, especially in the case of pTyr (Pedersen et al., 2017) . Therefore, in vitro phosphorylation by recombinant kinases (Zhang et al., 2011a) or the expressed protein ligationebased semisynthetic strategy (Pedersen et al., 2017) shows great promise for biochemical and structural characterization of these interactions. Although our knowledge of how phosphorylation regulates ligand binding is limited, design of a phosphoswitchable PDZ domain has been achieved, suggesting the possibility that novel PDZ domains with switchable ligand binding can be designed for novel purposes (Smith et al., 2013) .In addition to phosphorylation, reductioneoxidation (redox)-based modification is another mechanism that can regulate PDZ-domain interactions. A conformational change in the PDZ5 domain of INAD, a multi-PDZ domain scaffolding protein critical for vision, was found to be dependent on the formation of intramolecular disulfide bond (Mishra et al., 2007) . Formation of this disulfide bond bridged helix a2 and strand b3, distorting the normal ligand-binding groove typically seen in PDZ domains. Under reduced conditions, the disulfide bond was broken allowing helix a2 to relax back to the typical \\\"open\\\" position to accommodate a ligand (Fig. 8B) . Importantly, this oxidation/reduction cycle of disulfide and the accompanying distortion/relaxation of the ligand-binding pocket was light-dependent in vivo. Moreover, a C645S mutant in the PDZ domain that prevented disulfide formation showed defects in visual response and loss in refractory period, consistent with a dynamic conformational change mediating a regulatory switch in the INAD visual signaling pathway. Interestingly, a separate study found that the isolated PDZ5 was stable in the oxidized state, whereas it remained in the reduced state when linked to PDZ4. The presence of PDZ4 changed the local environment, raising the redox potential of the disulfide in the PDZ5 domain. Therefore, PDZ5 ligand binding was regulated by the redox environment and further allosterically controlled by the PDZ4 domain . Whether redox regulation of PDZ domain interactions is widespread is unknown and will require future studies.\\n\\nPDZ Domain Dynamics and Allostery\\n\\nThe three-dimensional structures of PDZ domains at atomic resolution have been exceptionally useful for characterizing the details of proteineligand interactions. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that proteins accomplish their biological functions (e.g., signal transduction, enzymatic catalysis, ligand binding, etc.) through multiple conformational states and the interconversion between them. Thus, protein dynamics is an important aspect in structureefunction relationships (Henzler-Wildman and Kern, 2007; Tzeng and Kalodimos, 2011; Wand, 2013) . Dynamics is also an important mechanism for allosterically regulating protein function. Protein dynamics on fast (ps-ns) and slow (ms-ms) timescales can be studied by solution NMR methods. Here, we first discuss fast timescale motions in the PDZ domains, which provide insight into changes in dynamics at the ligandbinding site and regions \\\"distal\\\" from it associated with allostery (see below). Later, we describe slower timescale motions associated with larger scale conformational changes in PDZ domains, which may also contribute to allosteric control of binding events.\\n\\nIntrinsic Dynamics and Allosteric Behavior\\n\\nNMR spectroscopy and computational simulations are widely utilized to monitor the dynamics of individual atoms in proteins. Sophisticated NMR analysis of fast timescale (pico-to nanosecond, ps-ns) motions results in two parameters: S 2 (order parameter) that describes the amplitude and s e that describes the timescale of bond vector dynamics, respectively. The 15 NeH bond vector is utilized to describe the backbone dynamics, whereas the methyl symmetry axis (collinear with CeCH 3 bond vector) describes methyl-containing residues (Igumenova et al., 2006) . In addition to fast timescale motions, slower dynamical motions can also be studied by NMR. These dynamics, on the micro-to millisecond (ms-ms) timescale, are generally studied by CarrePurcelleMeiboomeGill relaxation dispersion methods (Baldwin and Kay, 2009; Loria et al., 2008; Palmer, 2014) .The degree of backbone rigidity on the fast timescale has been studied in many PDZ domains and is typically correlated with stable elements of secondary structure. In apo PDZ domains, the loops connecting the secondary structures and at N-, C-termini are generally highly dynamic and flexible, and usually contain glycine residues that serve as hinges . Several PDZ domains show missing electron density in the b1eb2 loop in the absence of ligand (Fuentes et al., 2004; Law et al., 2009; Shepherd et al., 2010) . Moreover, structural alignment of various PDZ domains showed that b1eb2 and b2eb3 loops had higher root mean square deviation than other secondary structures. Nevertheless, these regions become rigidified after ligand binding as shown by NMR studies of various PDZ domains Fuentes et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2008a Liu et al., , 2013 Zhang et al., 2010) . In a few cases, the NMR resonance signals of the b2eb3 loop were extremely broadened in the NMR spectra (e.g., Leukemia-associated RhoGEF [LARG] [Liu et al., 2008a] and Tiam2 PDZ domains [unpublished data]) due to extensive dynamic motions.Fast-timescale dynamics of side chains, namely those with methyl groups, can be monitored using methyl groups (CeCH 3 vector) as the appropriate spinerelaxation vector. Moreover, their motions do not appear to correlate with secondary structure, and they are generally more sensitive to perturbations (e.g., ligand binding and mutations) because they exhibit larger fluctuations than those seen along the backbone . PDZ domains are excellent model systems for methyl-based experiments as they are relatively small (w90 amino acids) and typically contain 50e60 methyl-bearing residues evenly distributed throughout the protein.The side-chain dynamics of the second PDZ domain of the phosphatase 1e (PTP1e PDZ2) alone and complexed with a peptide derived from the RA-GEF2 protein showed changes in dynamics on ligand binding in the binding cleft, the b1eb2 and b2eb3 loops and other regions not directly involved in ligand binding (Fuentes et al., 2004) . In particular, methyl groups up to w11 \\u00c5 from the ligand-binding pocket were found to have perturbed dynamics on ligand binding and these regions were termed \\\"distal surface 1\\\" and \\\"distal surface 2.\\\" Distal surface 1 is located adjacent to the peptide-binding site near the N-terminus of b6 and b4eb5, whereas distal surface 2 is located near helix a1 (Fig. 9A) . A similar dynamic response was found with a distinct binding peptide, confirming the robustness of the dynamic transmission induced by ligand binding . A subsequent study compared the methyl side-chain dynamics of apo Erbin PDZ, PDZ3 from PSD-95, and PDZ2 from PTP1e and showed their dynamics to be highly similar (correlation coefficient of 0.65) (Law et al., 2009) . Given that PDZ domains contain w30% sequence identity, these results suggest that protein dynamics is a functionally conserved property of the PDZ-domain family. The long-range changes in dynamics have been validated in other PDZ domains using different methods, including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (Gerek and Ozkan, 2011) and binding kinetics studies (Gianni et al., 2006) . Importantly, the residues in PDZ domains experimentally found to be dynamically perturbed are consistent with a network of energetically connected residues (\\\"sparse energetic network\\\") originally identified in the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 (Lockless and Ranganathan, 1999) (Fig. 9B) . These coevolved residues are distributed sparsely on the primary sequence of the PDZ domain, but form a physically continuous network in the tertiary structure to link the active site with allosteric sites (Halabi et al., 2009) . The sparse network idea has progressed into the \\\"protein sectors\\\" concept, which defines these coevolved energetically or dynamically coupled residues as the basic architectural unit of three-dimensional structure. A high-throughput study found that mutations at sector positions had pronounced effects, such as switching the ligand-binding specificity, compared to those in nonsector positions (McLaughlin et al., 2012) . Moreover, some mutations did not switch specificity directly, but worked coordinately with other mutations in an epistatic manner. These so-called \\\"class-bridging\\\" mutations also resided in sector regions to maintain the original specificity and they worked allosterically to regulate the dynamics and function of the binding site (Raman et al., 2016) .Although the general dynamic response pattern in PDZ domains is conserved, specific perturbations can produce subtle variations in the pattern for an individual PDZ domain. One simple way to change the dynamic distribution (i.e., dynamic response) is by mutagenesis of residues at or near the ligand-binding site. Using a series of PDZ mutants in PTP1e PDZ2, a thorough side-chain dynamics study found that residue I20 served as a hub of this dynamic network, linking the ligand-binding site to the long-range distal sites (Fuentes et al., 2006) . The importance of this residue was also captured in a MD study of the PSD-95 PDZ3 domain (Ota and Agard, 2005) . Interestingly, a recent study showed that a single phosphorylation event of the ligand was also capable of propagating dramatic changes in dynamics, indicating that natural perturbations can also modulate dynamics and potentially ligand affinity (Liu et al., 2013) .Protein dynamics is important for enzymatic catalysis and ligand binding (Eisenmesser et al., 2005; Tzeng and Kalodimos, 2012) . In addition, dynamics in PDZ domains can affect ligand binding by modulating both affinity and specificity. A recent MD study on PSD-95 PDZ3 CRIPT complex showed that two charged residues in the b2eb3 loop interact with P -4 and P -7 residues in the ligand to form transient salt bridge interactions, providing an explanation for their role in supporting ligandbinding affinity. Interestingly, these interactions were not readily obvious in previous crystallography studies ( Mostarda et al., 2012) . Further, a \\\"specific-Gaussian network model\\\" analysis of various PDZ domains compared the dynamics pattern in class I and class II PDZ domains (Gerek et al., 2009) . Both classes of ligands changed the dynamics in the common b1eb2 loop. However, class I ligand binding also disturbed the motions in b2eb3 loop, whereas class II affected motions in helix a2. These studies suggest that the binding selectivity in PDZ domains can be modulated distinctly by the dynamics of specific residues. Indeed, the study by McLaughlin et al. (2012) showed that mutating two residues in the sector positions in PSD-95 PDZ3 could result in class switching by changing the binding preference from class I to class II ligand. Importantly, one of these residues was located in the b2eb3 loop and not directly involved in ligand binding, reinforcing the idea that dynamics in this loop contributes to ligand specificity.A significant role for fast-timescale dynamics in regulating PDZ-domain ligand binding was found in PSD-95. The structure of PSD-95 PDZ3 showed that an extended C-terminal helix, namely the a3 helix, packs against the core PDZ domain. Deletion of this helix (PDZ3 Da3 ) did not affect the overall structure of the PDZ domain, but surprisingly weakened the binding affinity for the CRIPT peptide w25-fold. ITC experiments suggested that the binding difference was driven by conformational entropy. The a3 helix does not directly participate in CRIPT ligand binding, and desolvation effects in binding were found negligible. Furthermore, NMR experiments showed that the side chains of the PDZ domain became more flexible on the psens timescale after removing a3 helix, whereas in the presence of ligand there was little difference in the dynamics of PDZ3 with and without a3 helix. Thus, the fast-timescale dynamics contributed to the entropic penalty, reducing ligand affinity after removal of the a3 helix (Petit et al., 2009) . This result was significant as only a few cases of pure dynamics-based regulation of ligand binding had been previously reported (Frederick et al., 2007; Popovych et al., 2006; Tzeng and Kalodimos, 2009 ). More importantly, this regulation was accomplished through an allosteric region, distal from the canonical PDZ-binding pocket. A recent follow-up study found that native state protein volume fluctuations is associated with the allostery in PSD-95 PDZ3. The PSD-95 PDZ3 Da3 had a significantly expanded volume compared to PDZ3 with the a3 helix.The unique packing of the PDZ3 Da3 domain was correlated to and works in concert with the increased internal motions to control the functional allostery, i.e., ligand binding (Law et al., 2017) .A second example of allostery-based regulation of binding is found in the Par-6 PDZ domain. Par-6 is an important scaffolding protein, part of Par-6/ Par-3/aPKC cell polarity complex (Lin et al., 2000) . The protein contains an N-terminal PDZ domain followed by a CRIB motif. The PDZ domain recognizes a model class I peptide (VKESLV COOH ) with an affinity of w80 mM. The adjacent CRIB motif binds to the Cdc42 GTPase and this interaction bolstered PDZ ligand binding w13-fold. This GTPase/Par-6 interaction is of crucial importance for tight junctions in epithelial cells. A structural study found large structural deviations in both the carboxylbinding loop and a2 helix of the Par-6 PDZ with and without Cdc42 binding and canonical PDZ domains. In presence of Cdc42, the Par-6 PDZ domain resembled a canonical PDZ domain with a suitable conformation for tight ligand binding (Fig. 9C) . Moreover, the shift between these distinct conformations in the carboxyl-binding loop suggested inherent dynamics (Peterson et al., 2004) . In the absence of Cdc42, the CRIB motif is disordered and flexible, gaining structure on Cdc42 binding. A disulfide stabilized CRIBePDZ mutant showed that high-affinity ligand binding was driven by a dipeptide conformational switch in the carboxyl-binding loop. This conformational change, driven by Cdc42/CRIB binding and stabilization of CRIB motif packing against a1 helix of the Par-6 PDZ, relied on the dynamics of carboxyl-binding loop (Whitney et al., 2011) . Detailed examination of msems timescale dynamics revealed conformational exchange throughout the entire PDZ domain, including the carboxyl-binding loop and involved partial unfolding of the PDZ domain (Fig. 9C ). This interdomain-based regulation of the Par-6 PDZ domain implied that intrinsic protein dynamics plays a role in allosteric regulation of ligand binding. Interestingly, the region involved in this regulation spanned the a1 helix to the carboxyl-binding loop and a2 helix, consistent with the dynamics and energetic pathway proposed by NMR-and in silico-based studies (Fuentes et al., 2004; Lockless and Ranganathan, 1999) . Moreover, the Crumbs ligand binding to Par-6 was also regulated by the Cdc42/CRIB-mediated allostery, suggesting a common mechanism for C-terminal ligands in Par-6 PDZ (Whitney et al., 2016) . In contrast, Cdc42 did not regulate binding to the Pals1 protein that binds the Par-6 PDZ domain through an internal sequence (Peterson et al., 2004) . The thermodynamic and structural rationale for this is unknown and will require additional work.Distinct timescales of dynamics control PDZ/ligand binding by different mechanisms, as shown by the PSD-95 and Par-6 PDZ examples. A recent study found both fast and slow dynamics coexisted in the same proteinda quadruple mutant (QM) of Tiam1 PDZ domaindand act distinctly to regulate ligand binding (Fig. 9D) . The Tiam1 QM PDZ domain was engineered with four mutations in the ligand-binding pocket designed to switch its specificity to that of its homolog, Tiam2 PDZ domain (Shepherd et al., 2011) . Binding experiments showed that the QM had a broadened specificity, reminiscent of the Tiam2 PDZ domain. Analysis of backbone and side chain fast-timescale dynamics and ITC data showed that conformational entropy contributed to ligand-binding affinity, similar to PSD-95 PDZ3. In contrast, slow dynamics was found throughout QM but not in WT, suggesting that slower conformational switching between multiple conformations was related to specificity by enabling the selection of a wider repertoire of ligands. Although not identical, the QM PDZ domain shares similar features found in the apo PDZ domains of AF-6 (Niu et al., 2007) and the Par-6 (Whitney et al., 2013) , in particular, conformational exchange in the ligand-binding site near the b2eb3 loop and a2 helix.The propagation of dynamics is one way for a PDZ domain to transmit allosteric signals. This mechanism of signal transmission involves no significant conformational change relying only on the entropic contribution from fast-timescale dynamics (Wand, 2013; Wand et al., 2013) , as shown in Tiam1 QM PDZ and PSD-95 PDZ3. In contrast, slow-timescale dynamics in the Tiam1 QM, AF-6, and Par-6 PDZ domains suggest an ensemble of slowly interconverting states. In this scenario, the upstream-signaling input (i.e., ligand binding) to this domain would likely stabilize a unique conformer, such as Cdc42 rendering the binding loop in Par-6 PDZ suitable for effective ligand binding, to further propagate the signal relay. Conversely, the native state might have a unique conformation, which on ligand binding could be redistributed or shifted into multiple conformations that are necessary for signaling (Swain and Gierasch, 2006) . Moreover, selection of a unique conformation by evolutionary pressure could provide novel PDZ specificity. Given the wide distribution of PDZ domain proteins in the human genome, each unique signal that a PDZ domain senses, and ultimately transmits, could represent a different dynamic state (Smock and Gierasch, 2009) . Although enticing, this idea requires further experimental testing in multiple PDZ-domain systems.\\n\\nPDZ Domain Allostery in Larger Fragments\\n\\nAllostery commonly refers to regulation of function by a distally located second site. In PDZ domains, allostery is defined as regulation of ligand binding from sites distal to the well-defined ligand-binding pocket, such as the a1 helix in Par-6 PDZ discussed above. Allostery can also originate from noncanonical extensions of the classical PDZ structure, such as the a3 helical extension in the PSD-95 PDZ3 domain. Here, we will discuss PDZ domain allostery derived from structural extensions, such as larger fragments or domains. This allostery was unraveled by a set of biophysical chemistry studies, rather than merely by NMR-based analyses. Indeed, a recent review predicted that one-third of PDZ domains contain functionally important extensions at either the N-and C-terminus of a PDZ domain or both (Wang et al., 2010a) . The predicted extensions were generally short, suggesting relatively tight packing against the PDZ domain core. Initial structural studies showed that a number of PDZ domains contained regions of secondary structure beyond their canonical fold at their N-or C-termini (Bhattacharya et al., 2010; Doyle et al., 1996) . These extended regions were required for correct folding and ligand binding. In particular, the MAGI PDZ1 had a tendency to aggregate during purification without a 25-residue long C-terminal extension, even though it was unstructured in both apo and ligand-bound states. Moreover, this C-terminal extension affected ligand binding. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies showed that mutations in three residues located in this extension decreased ligand affinity up to five fold. Intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effect indicated a direct interaction between residues of this region and the peptide ligand. Thus, the extended C-terminal region in the MAGI PDZ1 provided an additional binding site for its ligand .Longer PDZ domain extensions can also modulate function. In the NHERF-1 PDZ2, a 30-amino acid C-terminal extension formed a helixturn-helix motif, which stabilized the core PDZ domain and increased its affinity w10-fold to a C-terminal ligand from CFTR (Bhattacharya et al., 2010) . Intriguingly, three point mutations at NHERF-1 identified from patients with chronic kidney disease were located at this motif (Karim et al., 2008) . Biochemical studies showed that these mutations reduced the stability of the PDZ2 domain in cells, leading to the incorrect assembly of phosphate transporters at the cell membrane. Following this motif was an additional C-terminal w100 amino acid extension, known as an ezrin binding (EB) domain that recognizes the FERM domain in ezrin. The EB domain negatively regulated PDZ/ligand binding and when bound to the FERM domain increased PDZ/ligand affinity w20-fold (Li et al., 2005b) . NMR combined with SAXS studies showed that an extended C-terminal loop in the EB domain interacted with the PDZ-binding groove. However, in the presence of the FERM domain a conformational change relieved this inhibition (Bhattacharya et al., 2010; Cheng et al., 2009) . Taken together, PDZ/ligand binding can be bolstered or suppressed by distinct N-and C-terminal extensions to allosterically regulate the stability of a PDZ domain and its accessibility to ligand.PDZ domains can be regulated by both N-and C-terminal extension regions simultaneously, as seen in the harmonin PDZ domain. Harmonin is a scaffolding protein that plays an important role in the development of cilia in photoreceptors and hair cells. Harmonin interacts with Sans, another scaffolding protein in these cells (Reiners and Wolfrum, 2006) . Disruption of these proteineprotein interactions results in Usher syndrome, a common form of hereditary vision and hearing loss (Kremer et al., 2006) . A construct from the protein harmonin containing an N-terminal region, PDZ1 domain, and C-terminal 25-residue extension formed a stable supramodule (NPDZ1). X-ray crystallography studies clearly showed that the C-terminal extension in NPDZ1 packed against the linker region between the N-terminal domain and the PDZ1 domain through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. This supramodule was different from that typically formed by tandem PDZ domains. Biochemical studies showed that NPDZ1 interacted separately with the SAM domain or C-terminal PBM region of Sans, binding each with mM affinity. However, the tandem SAM-PBM region bound NPDZ1 with 1:1 stoichiometry and nM affinity (Yan et al., 2010) . The structure of the harmonin/Sans complex showed that the C-terminal tail of Sans inserted into the classical binding pocket of PDZ1, whereas helix a1 of the SAM domain packed into a new pocket formed by the PDZ a2eb5 region and the C-terminal extension. Thus, the PDZ domain and its extensions formed a supramodule to create a novel ligand-biding site. This binding site integrates a novel subsite and the canonical PDZ-binding site to provide a stable harmonin/Sans complex, necessary for the function of cilia in visual and hearing cells.As many PDZ proteins contain more than one PDZ domain, the influence of one PDZ domain on another is critical for understanding the overall function. This is particularly relevant as most biochemical and structural studies examine only one PDZ domain. However, more recent studies indicate that allosteric regulation can occur between adjacent PDZ domains.Studies of the PTP-BL PDZ2 showed promiscuity in ligand binding as it recognizes class I, II, and III ligands (van den Berk et al., 2007) . However, in the context of the double PDZ1ePDZ2 construct (PDZ12), the PDZ2 domain preferred class I ligands. NMR studies indicated that a physical interaction between PDZ1 and PDZ2 occurred through a site located at the a1/b1 region of PDZ2, opposite to the ligand-binding groove. Structural models suggested that the PDZ1ePDZ2 interaction might change the configuration of Ile48 in PDZ2, next to the a1 helix to form a hydrophobic interaction with P -1 Leu in class III ligands. This allosteric regulation was reminiscent of the Par-6 PDZ domain as both allosteric sites contained a1 helix.PDZ domains can also allosterically control the binding affinity of an adjacent PDZ domain. The best example of this is found in GRIP-1. The interaction between GluR2 and GRIP-1 was found to be mediated by the PDZ4 and PDZ5 domains in tandem. Interestingly, the binding stoichiometry was shown to be 1:1, but neither PDZ4 nor PDZ5 alone was able to bind to GluR2 (Zhang et al., 2001) . Further study verified that PDZ5 was the bona fide GluR2-interacting PDZ domain as it had a well-defined PDZ-binding groove, whereas the binding grove of PDZ4 was incapable of ligand binding (Feng et al., 2003) . Biochemical data showed that PDZ5 was stabilized by the N-terminal PDZ4 and the intra-domain linker region. Similarly, the GRIP-1 PDZ1 alone was not stable and it did not to bind to its ligand unless PDZ2 was present. Structural studies showed that the two PDZ domains packed against each other to form a compact intertwined domain with a large interface (w580 \\u00c5 2 ). Unlike PDZ4, PDZ2 contained a well-defined binding groove. However, it was still unable to bind ligand as the \\\"front-to-back\\\" packing mode in PDZ12 tandem blocked its binding site. Thus, PDZ1 was the only active-binding subunit and it was regulated allosterically by PDZ2 (Long et al., 2008) .Regulation of PDZ/ligand binding by an adjacent PDZ domain is also found in syntenin1 and PSD-95. Chemical denaturation of the syntenin1 constructs showed that the unfolding energy of PDZ12 was in between that of PDZ1 and PDZ2, suggesting that the tandem PDZ12 construct was associated into a folded and cooperative supramodule . Unlike the tandem PDZ45 domains of GRIP-1, both PDZ1 and PDZ2 of syntenin1 had intact binding grooves. However, their binding specificity was not identicaldPDZ1 bound class I and III ligands, whereas PDZ2 bound class I and II ligands. This degenerate binding preference, coupled with a unique orientation between the tandem PDZ domains in which PDZ2 is orientated approximately 90 degrees from PDZ1, was proposed to provide two scaffolding modes observed in the crystal structures of PDZ12 (Grembecka et al., 2006; Kang et al., 2003a,b) . In the first scaffolding mode, the two PDZ domains recognize multimeric membrane receptors with class I C-terminal tails (e.g., IL5Ra). In the second scaffolding mode, signals relayed from a class III receptor (e.g., syndecan4) to a class II downstream signaling molecule (e.g., merlin) can be transduced effectively by a single protein.PSD-95 is a prototypical member of the MAUGK family that contains a C-terminal SH3 domain, a GK domain, and three PDZ domains. The first two PDZ domains are connected by a short, five amino acid linker suggesting that it functions as a supramodule (Long et al., 2003) . Both PDZ domains were capable of binding to peptide ligands derived from the Kv1.4 potassium channel. Moreover, Kv1.4 binding synergy was observed with the PDZ12 domains compared to the individual PDZ domains. This simultaneous and cooperative binding induced clustering of the potassium channel. The NMR structure of tandem PDZ12 domain/ligand complex showed the two binding grooves were aligned in almost parallel orientation. However, the structural mechanism of ligand recognition was controversial, as subsequent crystal studies using a divalent peptide showed antiparallel binding for the two domains (Sainlos et al., 2011) . A recent study reported an antiparallel orientation in the apo state based on the distance restraints calculated from single molecule FRET experiments (McCann et al., 2011) . Interestingly, the orientation of PDZ12 alone was same as that in the full length PSD-95, but distinct from the orientation observed in the crystal structure of the ligand-bound state. The discrepancy in peptide orientations captured by different techniques suggests that PDZ12 may sample multiple conformations once bound to ligands. Consistent with this, NMR-relaxation experiments and MD simulations showed that the interdomain linker becomes flexible on ligand binding. The loss of the limited interdomian mobility created more conformational entropy to facilitate ligand binding . A SAXS study of PSD-95 PDZ12 showed that the interdomain distance became larger after dimer ligand binding, further supporting the flexible behavior of this supramodule in the bound state (Bach et al., 2012) . Overall, these distinct conformations suggest more than one scaffolding mode for PSD-95, similar to that seen in synte-nin1. Dimeric or multimeric receptors can be recognized by PDZ repeats in a parallel orientation, whereas monomeric receptors can be targeted by one of the PDZ domains in antiparallel orientation, with other downstreamsignaling molecules relayed by another PDZ (McCann et al., 2011) . A follow-up smFRET study found that PSD-95 formed complexes with different receptors and downstream effectors in a transient and short-lived manner. Thus, the binding kinetics in PDZ-mediated interactions may play more critical roles than affinities in forming complexes (McCann et al., 2011) . Integration of multiple biophysical techniques, in particular single molecule methods, should enable new insights into the dynamics and allosteric interplay between adjacent PDZs in scaffolding distinct receptors and downstream effectors.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\n\\nAlthough PDZ domains were identified over 20 years ago, they continue to provide new surprises with respect to their function and regulation. Their primary function is as a proteineligand interaction domain in cell signaling and they participate in many biological processes, including ion channel trafficking, neuronal development, and cellecell junctions. They bind a diverse set of ligandsdC-termini and internal sequences of proteins, phosphatidylinositol, and cholesteroldand binding can be regulated by phosphorylation and allosterically by protein interactions. Despite knowing much about the structure and specificity of individual PDZ domains, it is now clear that in the context of full-length proteins and larger order complexes PDZ domains possess more complex functions and regulatory mechanisms. Thus, PDZ domains are not just \\\"beads-on-a-string,\\\" but adaptable proteineligand interaction modules with the capacity to integrate their structure and function with other protein domains/regions. Because of their biological importance, individual PDZ domains and their interactions have been targeted for the development of inhibitors for a number of human diseases. To this end, several therapeutics have been developed that show promise. Given that there are over 500 PDZ domains in the human genome and only a small fraction have been well characterized, it is very likely that the future holds many new surprises.

Selected laboratories were enrolled into a collaborating network, the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) coordinated by WHO. Network membership depended on nomination by host government, on-site evaluation by WHO of physical infrastructure, availability of suitably qualified personnel, and ability to accurately implement recommended procedures for poliovirus detection and characterization. Although not every country has a GPLN laboratory, each is linked to designated laboratories where specimens could be referred for rapid testing. After the initial decade of growth linked to introduction of regional eradication goals and corresponding surveillance programs, GPLN membership has been mostly constant; currently, 146 laboratories are enrolled and originally categorized into 3 groups ( Figure 1 ) with defined responsibilities: (1) subnational and national laboratories (n = 123), (2) regional reference laboratories (n = 17), and (3) global specialized laboratories (n = 6).Laboratory diagnosis of poliovirus consists of 3 consecutive main procedures: viral isolation for detection of the virus; intratypic differentiation to distinguish vaccine strains from wild poliovirus (WPV) strains; and, finally, sequencing for molecular epidemiology. These procedures were aligned with the 3 tiers within the GPLN. During recent years, the capacities of these laboratories have evolved tremendously, and GPLN's laboratories have developed new capacities at all levels. It is noteworthy that >90 national/intercountry polio laboratories currently have intratypic differentiation capacity, and many regional and some national laboratories have sequencing capacities; 27 laboratories participated in the 2016 proficiency testing as part of establishing this recognized capacity. In addition, these expanded capabilities will be an important factor in fulfilling requirements of the WHO Global Action Plan to minimize the poliovirus facility-associated risk of introducing eradicated viruses into the population. As part of the process defined by this plan and with the aim of containing poliovirus in a few facilities, some specialized and regional laboratories will be designated as polio-essential facilities for containment of polioviruses.Since the beginning of the program, a core activity of the GPLN has been to test stool specimens from patients with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) for the presence of polioviruses. More recently, sewage specimens are also tested in several countries as a supplement to AFP surveillance. It is noteworthy that strengthening environmental surveillance is driven by the need to improve detection of poliovirus circulation in countries and areas where surveillance and immunization indicators are suboptimal. These expanded efforts were led by the GPLN and including sampling site selection, concentration of the sewage specimens, and characterization of the isolated polioviruses.The virological data provided by the GPLN, based on confirmed wild or vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) circulation, underpin the GPEI decisions regarding where targeted immunization and surveillance activities should be conducted. The data are also used to monitor progress toward polio eradication by documenting the decreasing genetic diversity and recognizing transmission links of poliovirus isolates.Other public health programs dedicated to control or elimination of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), have leveraged the GPLN model. The recently emerged or reemerged viral diseases-such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, dengue, Ebola, yellow fever, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and Zika virus disease-can also benefit from GPEI assets, including the GPLN platform. As polio eradication approaches, the polio endgame opens opportunities to formulate and validate the best strategies to transition all assets generated by the GPEI. Globally coordinated political and financial efforts and integrated platforms to control, eliminate, and eradicate infectious diseases will be needed to secure polio eradication and add value to other current and future public health initiatives. However, care should be taken not to jeopardize polio eradication goals by premature transitioning.\\n\\nTECHNICAL PILLARS OF THE GPLN Poliovirus Detection and Characterization Procedures\\n\\nWHO has standardized procedures used in the GPLN for testing of stool specimens from AFP cases. A consensus on recommended procedures was achieved through periodic informal consultative meetings convened by WHO for discussions among GPLN subjectmatter experts. Briefly, stool specimens from AFP cases are inoculated into cell cultures, and any polioviruses isolated have serotype and intratype determined. Partial genomic nucleotide sequences are generated for wild and programmatically important Sabin-related poliovirus isolates, and phylogenetic relationships among isolates are analyzed to investigate transmission linkages [2, 3] .None of the procedures used in the GPLN are available as commercial kits. Therefore, WHO assigns responsibility for production of standardized quality assured reagents to a few global specialized laboratories that also coordinate reagent and proficiency test distribution and collaborate to train personnel. The GPLN evaluates reagents, procedures and proficiency test materials under field conditions and on different equipment platforms to document performance characteristics and resolve operational concerns, in order to ensure accuracy of testing before adoption of new procedures.\\n\\nCapacity Building\\n\\nAt enrollment, GPLN members varied in their capacities for laboratory testing. WHO laboratory coordinators in headquarters and all 6 regions, then and now, evaluate needs and leverage support from government and/or GPEI international partners to fill identified gaps and ensure uninterrupted availability of trained personnel; material resources for testing, analysis, and reporting of results; and appropriate infrastructure for safe storage and handling and disposal of infectious materials. A mixed approach is used to train personnel. Regional workshops are the most cost-effective way to simultaneously train multiple persons using standardized training curricula that allows time for practical work and covers theoretical aspects of procedures, equipment (selection, maintenance, and calibration), results analysis and interpretation, troubleshooting, reporting, and discussion of safety. An added benefit is the fostering of collaborative linkages with facilitators and peer learning Diop among participants. Two other training approaches are on-site training conducted by WHO staff or consultants, and trainee assignments to reference laboratories.\\n\\nIndicators for Monitoring Laboratory Performance\\n\\nProcess indicators are used to monitor completion of each stage of testing and overall reporting time to ensure the timely availability of results for program action. Outcome indicators monitor the accuracy of testing through testing of quality control materials and annual proficiency tests. Overall quality assurance is monitored through annual auditing of network laboratories by WHO-assigned external reviewers, who use a standardized checklist and scoring system to determine whether laboratories meet defined performance criteria. Laboratories that fail the audit must test samples in parallel with an accredited reference laboratory until performance problems are resolved.\\n\\nResults Reporting, Data Sharing, Management, and Ownership\\n\\nThe GPEI is a data-driven program. Laboratory results confirm geographic locations of poliovirus transmission and are used in planning of responsive immunization actions. Data sharing relationships were established among laboratories and immunization and surveillance personnel ( Figure 2 ). In early phases of the GPEI, electronic data management systems and Internet were absent from many laboratories in resource-constrained settings. WHO mobilized resources and designed databases, procured computer and communication equipment, and trained laboratory personnel in electronic data management.Currently, laboratories share databases weekly with WHO and national authorities. WPV, VDPV, and partial genomic nucleotide sequence results, however, are shared within 1-2 days of their availability. Separate databases are maintained by laboratories that sequence viruses, but sequences are shared among laboratories as needed to perform phylogenetic analyses, particularly related to virus importations and VDPV emergence. In the event of new scientific discoveries, all laboratories making significant contributions to testing and analysis are represented among coauthors of scientific publications.\\n\\nChanges in Management\\n\\nAs the GPEI program evolved, changes to AFP surveillance policies (eg, universal adoption of virological confirmation and discontinuing use of the poliomyelitis clinical case definition) and performance targets (AFP case detection rate shifted from 1 to 2 per 100 000 in persons <15 years of age in polio-endemic regions) [4, 5] caused significant increases in laboratory workloads ( Figure 3 ). The GPLN responded with diverse approaches that included increasing staffing levels and testing supplies redistribution of specimens to other laboratories with capacity, and extending work time or adding work shifts to manage workload.As foci and intensity of WPV transmission decreased, WHO shortened target laboratory reporting time ( Figure 4 ) to expedite implementation of responsive immunization campaigns. The GPLN achieved a 50% reduction in reporting time by changing the testing algorithm, which shortened the observation time for inoculated cell cultures and replaced serological based testing with faster molecular tests to determine serotype and intratype and screen for VDPVs [2, 6, 7] . Another significant change was building capacity in more laboratories to perform molecular tests, which eliminated the time associated with shipping specimens and isolates between laboratories.Detection of a poliomyelitis outbreak in Hispaniola caused by circulation of VDPV type 1 viruses [8] caused further changes in the GPLN. Retrospective nucleotide sequencing of archived Sabin-related polioviruses confirmed a prior multiyear VDPV type 2 outbreak in Egypt. The GPLN developed, evaluated, and implemented a real-time polymerase chain reaction procedure to routinely screen Sabin-related isolates to detect certain key mutations commonly found in VDPVs [7] . During field evaluation of the method, VDPV outbreaks were retrospectively detected in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, and Nigeria [9] .Suspicions about weaknesses in AFP surveillance based on detection of genetic gaps among WPVs in some countries led to adoption of a supplemental surveillance approach that involves testing sewage samples collected from the environment or treatment plants [10] . \\n\\nCharacterization of Costs\\n\\nThe GPLN surveyed its members to characterize the costs and funding sources for work done in support of the GPEI [11] . The survey documented that governments are the major funders, meeting the majority of operational and staffing costs for laboratories. GPEI partners mostly support training of personnel, production of standardized test reagents and control materials, proficiency test programs, procurement of commodities in a few reference laboratories that serve multiple countries, and personnel costs associated with network coordination. These survey results were used by WHO for planning and resource mobilization. A key finding of this survey is that approximately 10% of the GPEI's total AFP surveillance budget is spent on the GPLN, which highlights the fact that the expected value of surveillance information from the GPLN currently exceeds its costs.\\n\\nINITIATIVES\\n\\nAn enduring contribution of polio eradication and the GPLN is the close integration on a global scale of field and laboratory-based surveillance and public health action. Before the launch of the GPEI and development of the GPLN, such integration was sporadic in many settings and virtually nonexistent in others. The GPLN opened an avenue for virologists and microbiologists worldwide to contribute more directly to the public health needs within and beyond their own communities. The clearly evident benefits of the GPEI and other VPD control programs fostered development of additional global and Regional laboratory networks supporting surveillance for other VPDs. Conditions for establishment and maintenance of laboratory networks, however, vary widely across WHO regions and the phases of each VPD control program.\\n\\nAdding Value by Laboratory Networking\\n\\nEstablishment of the first comprehensive regional polio laboratory network in the Americas benefitted from the relative prosperity of the region, a widely shared Pan-American perspective, and the prospect of regional polio eradication within 5 years [12] . However, with certification of polio-free status by the Regional Certification Commission in 1994 [13] , emphasis quickly shifted from polio to other VPDs, especially measles and rubella, and new regional networks grew from the polio network. This serially focused approach to VPD control aimed to leverage the gains in vaccine coverage and surveillance achieved through polio eradication, while effectively using the limited public health resources available. Success hinged on the relative geographic separation of the Americas and the moderate transmissibility of poliovirus.The Western Pacific Region, with China at its center, has maintained sensitive poliovirus surveillance since certification in 2000 [14] , as the risk of outbreaks from imported virus [15, 16] and VDPV emergence continues [17, 18] , even as it expands laboratory support to broader VPD control activities. The European Region, certified polio free in 2002 [19] has maintained high rates of vaccine coverage in Western and Central Europe, but coverage and integrated poliovirus surveillance declined as resources were redirected in some Central Asian and Eastern European countries, leading to outbreaks from imported WPV [20] and VDPVs [18] . Virologists in India and other countries in the South-East Asia Region have continued to support intensive, sensitive poliovirus surveillance since certification in 2014 [21] , as their colleagues in the African and Eastern Mediterranean regions continue to track the last chains of WPV transmission [22] and alert the GPEI of the emergence of VDPVs [18] . All GPLN laboratories are needed to help the GPEI safely navigate the polio endgame [23] .Laboratories of the GPLN have been instrumental in the initial detection and characterization of newly emerging pathogens and diseases of public health importance, including severe acute respiratory syndrome, outbreaks of paralytic disease associated with enterovirus 71, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Many of the molecular methods first introduced by the GPLN, such as diagnostic polymerase chain reaction and genetic sequencing as an epidemiological tool, are now widely applied throughout other laboratory networks to identify and track infectious disease agents (eg, Ebola recently).\\n\\nBuilding on Geographic and Technical Convergences Between Laboratory Networks\\n\\nFrom the outset, polio eradication was seen as the next step in a long-term strategy for global control of VPDs, with the concomitant strengthening of global public health infrastructure, including public health laboratories. Active collaboration across VPD laboratory networks is facilitated by overlapping technical expertise, frequent colocation of \\n\\nEnsuring Continued Support to Public Health Activities\\n\\nAlthough continued poliovirus surveillance and laboratory investigations remain essential to secure the endgame [23] , the GPLN will continue to serve as a model for infectious disease laboratory networks. This is especially true for VPD networks, which support efforts to \\\"go on offense\\\" against infectious diseases. Although VPD networks have still untapped potential to support key public health initiatives, many VPD laboratories and their supporting WHO coordinators are severely overstretched. Further expansion of capacity will require additional investments in human as well as material resources, investments which have proved to be highly cost-effective. Fundamental to this goal is the need for (1) strong ownership of laboratory networks by countries and/or regional bodies, including sustained funding, and (2) investments by all countries in the academic training of laboratory staff prepared to support future, broadened public health initiatives.\\n\\nACTIVITIES Situational Analysis\\n\\nA SWOT (strength, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis after 25 years of GPLN functioning was conducted in 2014. The main outcomes are compiled in Figure 5 . In summary, the members of the GPLN have stressed the following strengths: the network structure, the efficient collaboration/coordination at different levels within the GPLN, the integration with the Expanded Program for Immunization, the high competency and reliability of laboratory personnel, the ability to adopt new methods, an excellent quality assurance system ensuring accuracy of results, and a strong laboratory data management system. The main areas where the GPLN should continue improvement efforts include finding sustainable mechanisms for national support, streamlining financial support to laboratories, and strengthening managerial skills at laboratory level. Lessons learned from the GPLN should help foster interregional relationships under the Global Health Security Agenda framework to build countries' capacities and optimize costs to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious diseases threats.Over the years, the GPLN has efficiently demonstrated capacity to overcome weaknesses and threats. As an example, communication with Expanded Program for Immunization personnel has been improved, ensuring tight and efficient links between the 2 components of the AFP surveillance system. Moreover, the high turnover rate of competent staff has always been compensated by regular training and integration of new staff.In addition, whenever funding or capacity building opportunities were offered by GPEI partners, the GPLN was able to leverage resources and innovate to maintain high quality standards. Implementation of environmental surveillance of polioviruses in 13 GPLN laboratories in the African, Eastern Mediterranean, and South-East Asia regions during the last 5 years highlights the receptivity to changes aiming to improve diagnostic capacities of the network [24] . Rapid evolution and adoption of molecular assays for detection of WPVs and VDPVs is another significant example.\\n\\nNeed for Protecting Investments and Sustaining Services Until Global Certification and Beyond\\n\\nSince its creation, the GPLN has accumulated tremendous investments in human resources, infrastructures and equipment. Furthermore it was able to build an efficient networking system to proactively identify gaps and propose adequate solutions and be able to efficiently conduct troubleshooting, learn lessons and develop improvement plans. As an example, the real-time monitoring of poliovirus evolution has permitted timely adaptation of molecular diagnostic procedures in 2015 to detect viruses belonging to new clusters or lineages. At this stage of the GPEI, it is of utmost importance to protect these investments, mainly the biggest assets of the GPLN, its well-trained and dedicated human resources and efficient operational principles.Indeed, there is a need to sustain the services and contributions of polio laboratories through and beyond the process of global certification of poliomyelitis eradication. Transitioning the GPLN assets toward other public health programs is an important part of the endgame strategic plan, and it is noteworthy that GPEI partners increasingly recognize the worth of building health systems rather than focusing on specific vertical programs or initiatives.A quick review of the ongoing consultations and brainstorming on this area of work points toward different options for the future of the GPLN, the main ones being evolution toward regional laboratory networks devoted to specific diseases, integration with existing global VPD laboratory networks, and transforming the GPLN to a core network for broader support of public health activities and emergencies.It is clear and consensual that an efficient public health laboratory is needed in all countries, but to reach this goal several challenges need to be overcome. First, in many low-resource countries, the health laboratory network is nonexistent owing to lack of infrastructure, which hampers adequate mainstreaming of polio surveillance functions (needed in the long-term) into national activities. Second, this heterogeneity among countries' capacities makes difficult to align visions, secure resources, and ensure efficient in-country implementation of any transition plan. Finally, it is critical to build networking capacity up front among all stakeholders to ensure successful transition.For each of these options it is necessary to conduct in-depth analysis of costs and comprehensively weigh health and financial benefits, cost-effectiveness, and cost savings. Indeed, maintaining political commitment and funding from countries and donors is the key driver for a successful transition of GPLN assets to support public health programs, and this can be obtained only if clear and measurable objectives are established and benefits are clearly delineated.\\n\\nKEY PREREQUISITES TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF THE TRANSITION Aligning Visions of GPEI Partners\\n\\nThere are several enabling factors for successful transition of GPLN assets. The first is alignment across the GPEI partnership on the direction of the program after certification, which will provide a solid ground for a platform that includes (1) retaining a postcertification surveillance capacity to sustain polio eradication, (2) continuing to share assets with established laboratory networks for effective integration, and (3) using human resources and operational assets to provide support for emerging and reemerging diseases outbreaks.\\n\\nFunding\\n\\nDevelopment of this platform can meet the interests of different stakeholders and donors to build health systems rather than funding competing health programs that affect performance of highly qualified laboratory personnel and cost-effectiveness. However, because donor funding is difficult to predict, maintaining the fundraising capacity of the GPEI should be part of the global transition plan. The model of polio surveillance to be implemented after eradication, mainly the environmental surveillance of poliovirus in this model, will be the cost driver and needs to be carefully considered to ensure the sustainability of the platform. Indeed, when eradication of polio will be achieved after several missed milestones and setbacks, engagement of different stakeholders for long-term support may change. At that point, the best insurance that base-level funds will continue to be available is to convince donors of the cost-effectiveness of their investments.\\n\\nDelineating Short-and Long-Term Transition Activities\\n\\nFrom lessons learned in building laboratory capacity and networks, a phased transitioning strategy of GPLN assets that clearly distinguishes short-term activities after certification (section Aligning Visions of GPEI Partners above) and a long-term plan seems the best way to develop the platform successfully. While moving forward with this process, the GPLN should ensure that unfinished works in the current strategic plan are completed (eg, diversification and strengthening of laboratory personnel's managerial skills, renewal of old equipment, and scale-up of effective modern communication and information systems).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\n\\nThe GPLN since its creation in 1989 has provided valuable support to the GPEI by ensuring that timely and accurate data are available to orient both field surveillance and immunization activities. Although polio eradication is getting closer, it is of utmost importance to secure eradication but also plan for transitioning skills and assets that were built worldwide during >2 decades. Because the GPLN is perceived as one valuable part of the GPEI to be leveraged, this article describes some of its achievements ( Figure 6 ) and potential avenues for better use of this network after certification. At the GPEI level, ongoing work aims to identify opportunities for integration of polio assets and/or functions into other program areas or mainstream them into the national health infrastructure.The simplest thinking is to fully transition GPLN assets to VPD networks that have already built their capacities based on the GPLN model. In fact, integration of the GPLN with these networks is already a reality in places where both capacities coexist in the same laboratory. This integration of (1) skills and assets (human resources, infrastructures, equipment, and consumables) and (2) activities related to quality management needs to be pursued and reinforced, the prerequisite being sustained funding of the GPLN. It is not certain that the level of funding for eradication, elimination, and/or control initiatives will be maintained. Importantly, GPLN's skills and assets that can really make the difference are the established networking system and the highly trained staff in charge of operations to ensure both the efficiency and sustainability of laboratory support to eradication programs but also to other public health interventions where and when needed (eg, influenza pandemic or Ebola crisis).Therefore, transition planning to enable both (1) maintenance of a polio diagnostic capacity to secure polio eradication and (2) development of a core capacity/platform, which can be used to support VPDs but also outbreaks or events of emerging or reemerging diseases, will be the best trade-off to reconcile and manage expectations from GPEI's partners, other global public health initiatives, and WHO member states. Furthermore, this process will allow retention of skilled laboratory staff by engaging them in new areas of work, preserve the essential linkages between field and laboratory surveillance, and consequently maintain the capacities of countries to respond to health emergencies.While planning the transition of GPLN assets and skills toward support of other public health initiatives, it is important to comprehensively map out, evaluate, and document investments, assets, and skills that have maintained and strengthened the GPLN system, including networking capacity, for nearly 27 years. This information will inform a GPEI position paper on how to manage risks and opportunities associated with the eradication of polio and provide support to member states for a successful transition.

(TGE) and also caused by a coronavirus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (Witte et al., 1981; Pensaert and Callebaut, 1982) . Two clinical forms of the disease have been described; PED Type I affects only pigs up to 4-5 weeks, while Type II outbreaks affect swine of all ages. Clinically, the disease is characterized by profuse watery diarrhea, high morbidity (close to 100%) and relatively low mortality, but still causing important economic losses to the pig producer (Pensaert, 1989) . Hofmann and Wyler ( 1988) described PEDV isolation for the first time in cell culture using Vero cells and trypsin-supplemented medium. Since then, several diagnostic methods have been described for the detection of both PEDV antigen and its antibodies (Hofmann and Wyler, 1990; Van Nieuwstadt and Zetstra, 1991; Knuchel et al., 1992) .In Spain, an outbreak of porcine gastroenteritis was described in 1985 in a province of Castilla y Le6n (CyL) region and PEDV was identified as the etiological agent by electron microscopy and blocking ELISA (Jimenez et al., 1985) . Since then, no further studies have been performed to determine the prevalence of PEDV infections in Spain, whereas prevalence of other swine coronaviruses like porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) infections have been extensively studied (Rubio et al., 1987; Cuber0 et al., 1993; Martin et al., 1994) . The purpose of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of PEDV seropositivity among breeding swine farms from CyL, a region which concentrates nearly 25% of the Spanish breeding sow census, taking into account the different types of pig farms and management conditions.\\n\\nSampling\\n\\nThe target of this survey was the farms housing breeding pigs of eight provinces of CyL. Breeding pigs were chosen because of their extended lifespan compared with fattening swine which increases the probability of contact with infectious agents and develop a serum antibody response (Miiller et al., 1990) .CyL is the largest region in the European Community (EC), and includes most of the central and relatively high (700 m above sea level) plateau of Spain. It is divided into nine different provinces but all of them are geographically similar. In August 1991 the breeding sow population in the sampled area was 430 000 animals distributed over 39 522 farms, which represented nearly 25% of the Spanish and 2.4% of the EC breeding sow census.Farms with a small number of animals are very important in this region as shown by the small mean number of sows per breeding farm ( 10.8). Therefore, to prevent sampling bias, farms were stratified into three different categories depending on the number of sows (a key factor determining both management practices and hygienic conditions) as follows:( 1) Small farms: farms with 20 or less breeding sows. There is great variability among this type of farm in the management practices and hygienic conditions, but they usually are deficient. These farms represent frequently a secondary income source for the farmers and so, conditions of housing facilities, type of feed, breed selection, etc. are rarely improved. Piglets are usually sold after weaning to large fattening farms. In the sampled area the number of small farms was 34 175.(2) Medium size farms: herds containing between 21 and 100 breeding sows, generally with better management and hygienic conditions than the small ones. They perform either breeding only or a fat-row-to-finish operation. The total number in the region was 4749.(3) Large farms: this category includes 598 herds with more than 100 breeding sows, in which management practices and hygienic conditions are generally satisfactory. In this category, most of the farms finish their own pigs and use an all-in-all-out system.In one of the sampled provinces (Salamanca), there is a particular extensive managed type of farms. These are herds with an average number of 70 sows of a particular breed of pigs (Iberico). Extensive farms are mainly characterized by keeping the sows outdoors in the field during most of the production cycle, housing them only while nursing. During the survey we collected data about the extensive or intensive type of production in the sampled farms of Salamanca.The number of herds to be sampled within each farm category for estimating the prevalence of infected farms was calculated using the EPISCOPE computer package (Frankena et al., 1990) , taking data from the latest available census (August 1990) of swine breeding farms of CyL (data from the Consejeria of Agriculture and Livestock of Castilla y Leon). We took 33% as the expected prevalence of PEDV seropositive breeding farms, as detected in a serosurvey carried out in Belgium (Pensaert, 1986) and we calculated that, with a 95% confidence level and an absolute error of less than or equal to 5%, a total number of 300 small farms, 300 medium farms and 175 large farms had to be sampled. The total sample size was proportionally divided according to the number of breeding farms within each of the sampled provinces.The number of animals to be sampled within each herd was obtained from the formula of sample size for the detection of disease (Martin et al., 1987) . We took 55% as the expected prevalence of seropositive animals within a herd, data obtained from two PED outbreaks diagnosed by us in this region, where we found a prevalence of seropositive pigs per herd of 53 and 60%, respectively, 3 months after the onset of the outbreak. The calculated number of serum samples to be taken per farm was three to four for small herds, between four and seven (maximum ten serum samples) for medium size farms and seven or greater for large farms (maximum 15 sera) Both herds and sows within a herd were randomly selected from census data using a random number generator. Serum samples were provided by the Regional Animal Health Laboratory from samples submitted for the African swine fever eradication program. A total of 5052 serum samples from 803 different farms were collected throughout 1992-1993 with the following distribution: 983 sows from 309 small farms, 23 17 sows from 3 19 medium size farms and 1752 sows from 175 large farms.Blood was allowed to clot, centrifuged and the serum kept at -30\\u00b0C until tested.\\n\\nSerological test\\n\\nPEDV-specific antibodies were detected in serum samples using a blocking-ELISA method, as described by Van Nieuwstadt and Zetstra ( 1991) with several modifications. Briefly, polystyrene microtiter plates were coated with monoclonal antibody (mAb) CVI-PEDV-66.3 1 and in a second step a mixture of gut-origin PEDV antigen and a 1:2.5 dilution of the test serum was added to each well. After washing, remaining free antigen (not blocked by the test serum) was detected with a second mAb (CVI-PEDV 66.49) labelled with peroxidase. For each plate, four wells without serum were included as negative controls (blank), and two wells with hyperimmune anti-PEDV pig serum as positive controls. Then, the mean absorbance at 450 nm (Ad& of the four blank wells was calculated, and the blocking percentage for each test serum calculated from the formula:Blocking percentage= 100% -(A450 serum/mean Adso blank) X 100% A sample was considered positive when blocking percentage was > 50%.Relative sensitivity and specificity of this test were 85.7% and 86.9%, respectively, when compared with a blocking ELISA described by using polyclonal antibodies (Carvajal et al., 1993) .\\n\\nStatistical analysis\\n\\nThe farm was taken as the unit of concern. A herd was considered positive when at least one of the sampled animals was positive and for each positive farm, within-farm seropositivity was calculated as the ratio between the number of positive sera and the total number of sampled animals in this farm. Also, mean blocking percentage of positive samples per farm was calculated.The chi-square test at (Y = 0.05 was used to detect any association between the prevalences of seropositive herds among the different farm size categories and between extensive and intensive production. The correlation between the prevalence of seropositive sows per herd (within-farm seropositivity) and the size of the farm was calculated using the Pearson product moment correlation for uncategorized variables.The detection of significant differences between mean blocking percentages across the different farm categories was performed by ANOVA at a = 0.05. For the statistical analysis the EPI INFO (v.5) computer package (Dean et al., 1990) and STATISTICA for Windows, v.4.0 (Statsoft, Inc.) were used.\\n\\nResults\\n\\nBy blocking ELISA 15 13 out of 5052 sera tested (29.9%) were seropositive. A total of 442 herds out of 803 sampled (55.9%) had PEDV seropositive sows (Table 1) .Comparing the prevalence of PEDV seropositivity across the different farm size categories, we found similar figures in large and medium size farms (65.1 and 67.8% positive herds, respectively). However, the prevalence of positive small farms (38.1%) was significantly lower (x2 = 16.8 and 13.5, respectively, P < 0.001 ) ( Table 1) .We found a highly significant negative correlation between farm size and within-farm seropositivity using the Pearson product moment correlation test ( r,r = -0.12, P < 0.001 ), meaning that the number of positive samples per farm decreased significantly with increased size of the herd.Since positive sera were not titrated, the blocking percentage was taken as a quantitative measure of the positivity of a particular sample. As shown in Table 1 , mean blocking percentage of positive sera also tended to decrease while increasing the farm size. The A herd was considered positive when at least one of the sampled sows reached a blocking percentage > 50% in the blocking-ELISA. Blocking percentage was determined for each positive farm as the mean of the blocking percentage of each of the positive sera. Within-farm seropositivity was calculated as the ratio between the number of positive sera and the total number of sampled animals in this farm. A herd was considered positive when at least one of the sampled sows reached a blocking percentage 250% in the blocking-ELISA. Blocking percentage was determined for each positive farm as the mean of the blocking percentage of each of the positive sera. Within-farm seropositivity was calculated as the ratio between the number of positive sera and the total number of sampled animals in this farm. differences between small and medium size farms did not reach statistical significance, but the mean blocking percentage in large farms was significantly lower than in medium size (F= 8.56, P=O.O03) and small farms (F=6.84, P=O.O09).Comparing the prevalence of PEDV seropositivity between extensive and intensive farms in the province of Salamanca, the only where this type of production exists, we found significant differences ( 19.5% and 32% of positive herds, respectively) but no differences were found in either the mean blocking percentage or in within-herd seropositivity data between both types of production (Table 2) .\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nAlthough PEDV infection was described in the central part of Spain in 1985 (Jimtnez et al., 1985 , no studies have been performed since then to determine the importance of this infection among the Spanish swine population. During the last few years many acute diarrhea1 outbreaks affecting swine of all ages have been reported by practitioners in the sampled area (J. Lamana, personal communication, 1990) . In another serosurvey carried out in the same area in 1988, no TGEV-specific antibodies were found among breeding swine, thus ruling out TGE as the cause . In the present study we have shown that PEDV infection is widespread among swine breeding population in the CyL region, which leads us to consider this virus as a potentially part of the etiology of diarrhea1 outbreaks.The prevalence of PEDV-seropositive breeding sows found (29.6%) is similar to that reported by in Belgium (32%), but much higher than the 5.6% prevalence found in Switzerland (Hofmann and Wyler, 1987) . We also found a high prevalence of seropositive breeding farms (55.9%). There are no previous data about the prevalence in breeding farms in other countries, only from fattening or breeding and fattening farms from Belgium and Switzerland, with 33% and 28% of seropositive herds, respectively. The reasons why PEDV infection is so widespread among swine breeding farms in Spain remain unclear, but two facts could explain it. On the one hand, much of the replacement breeding stock is imported from other EC countries and also, Spain is a net piglet importer. All this traffic of animals would help in the dissemination of PEDV infection to other farms. On the other hand, the improvement of the screening methods, as compared with the ones used by other authors for epidemiological purposes, previous to the isolation of PEDV in cell culture, may explain a higher sensitivity and thus a higher number of positive animals detected.Similarly to what has been described for TGE (Cuber0 et al., 1993), we found a higher prevalence of seropositive herds among the large and medium sized farms as compared with small ones. Taking into account that the entrance of PEDV in a farm is mainly by infected animals or by fecal-contaminated materials, large farms have a higher risk of infection because of the higher movement of animals, persons and vehicles.We found a highly negative correlation between farm size and within-herd seroprevalence. The higher within-herd seroprevalence in small farms could be due to the easier spread of the infection among all the sows, since this type of farm normally houses the animals in only one barn throughout all the reproductive cycle and they do not use an all-in-all-out system. Also, in small herds, sows are usually not restrained, and this freedom of movement in the barn increases the probability of contact with fecal material from another sows. On the other hand, in large farms an average of 35% of the breeding sows are replaced annually and also this could explain the lower within-farm seroprevalence rates found.Comparing mean blocking percentages between the different farm categories, we found significantly higher values in small and medium-sized farms than in large ones. PEDV infection was considered self-limiting, but recently, Pijpers et al. ( 1993) demonstrated that the virus can persist in a farm after an initial outbreak if there is a continuous input of susceptible animals. The lower antibody titer detected in large farms, as measured by the blocking percentage, together with the high prevalence of seropositive large farms could be a sign of the presence of endemic infections in this type of farm. Also, the lower replacement rate in small farms could increase the possibility for a sow to suffer a reinfection and develop a stronger antibody response.Significant differences were also found in PEDV seropositivity among extensively and intensively managed farms in the province of Salamanca, with lower rates in the extensive ones, as could be expected by the special breed and production system where there is a very limited interchange of animals between different farms.This study confirms the importance of PEDV infection, which has been traditionally underestimated, in the etiology of enteric diseases of swine in Spain. We suggest that this virus should always be considered when diagnosing pig diarrhea.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Introduction\\n\\nWhile the presentation of a patient with undifferentiated febrile illness to the emergency department is rarely a cause for alarm, the additional factor of recent international travel suggests a host of unusual pathogens, some with the potential for rapid and devastating transmission among both patients and health care workers. Other infectious diseases may lead to significant morbidity and mortality if not rapidly identified and treatment initiated. With the current ease and rapidity of global travel, the likelihood that exotic infectious agents may appear at any given hospital has increased significantly. The search for these rare diseases should not, however, come at the expense of a ''common sense'' approach to the evaluation of the febrile patient. Additional information about specific international travel destinations can help guide the evaluation while suggesting more likely infectious agents that may be endemic to that region.Common things being common, febrile patientsd even those returning from destinations in developing nationsdare still likely to present with routine viral and bacterial illnesses. 1,2 A prospective review of 195 febrile patients requiring admission after returning to the United Kingdom from the tropics found that while malaria (42%) was the most common cause for hospital admission, non-specific viral illness and bacterial infections (including urinary tract infection, community-acquired pneumonia and pharyngitis) accounted for 34% of patients. 2 In this issue, Woodrow et al., demonstrate in their work on viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) screening that a more comprehensive strategy that accounts for even rare pathogens is likely the most appropriate means of evaluating the febrile returned traveler. 3 In their article, they develop a risk-stratification strategy for patients presenting to the London Hospital for tropical diseases with fever in an effort to identify those patients at moderate or high risk for VHF. Through a simple triage tool that uses criteria including recent fever, travel to a country endemic for VHF, travel outside urban areas or contact with animals, they demonstrate that patients with moderate or high risk for VHF can be identified without the need for unnecessary hospitalization or extensive use of viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Expanding this methodology to account for other potential infectious agents that may present to a given hospital or emergency department can provide some guidance for clinicians who may encounter febrile patients who have recently returned from any geographic region, unwittingly harboring undiagnosed viral, bacterial or parasitic infection.\\n\\nTravel history\\n\\nRather than a scattershot approach to evaluation of the febrile returned traveler where all patients are tested for virtually any etiology, a focused strategy is more likely to be effective. A concise, specific, travel history is essential, including names of visited countries and regions, duration and purpose of visit, as well as trips to non-urban areas or areas where infectious diseases are known to be endemic. Freedman et al., in a recent review of GeoSentinel infectious disease surveillance data gathered on more than 17,000 patients from 30 sites worldwide, found that significant regional differences were noted among ill returned travelers. 4 Specific destinations were associated with increased probability of certain diseases, potentially guiding diagnostic and empiric treatment strategies.After an initial travel history is obtained, a list of the most likely etiologies for a patient's illness can be developed based on the relative risk of various illnesses according to geographic region. For example, in patients returning from recent travel to sub-Saharan Africa, malaria is generally the most common cause of systemic febrile illness, while among recent visitors to Central and South America, both dengue fever and malaria are seen in equal numbers. Table 1 , from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ''Yellow Book,'' Health Information for International Travel, 2005e2006, provides a list of these endemic pathogens as well as the geographic regions where travelers may potentially encounter these illnesses. 5 Travelers to geographic areas where there is elevated risk for infection with endemic pathogens should be viewed with high suspicion if a history of fever or other systemic symptoms is elicited.\\n\\nExposure history\\n\\nIn addition, information regarding specific exposures, such as contaminated food or water, insect bite or ill contacts can help narrow the differential diagnosis for the febrile traveler (see Table 2 ). Consumption of untreated water or unpasteurized dairy products can lead to hepatitis A (in an unvaccinated traveler), salmonellosis, shigellosis, as well as parasitic infections such as giardiasis. 6 Although substantially less common, rare food-borne illnesses such as cholera may also occur. The incidence of traveler's diarrhea has been estimated to be as high as 20e60% in visitors to underdeveloped nations and the GeoSentinel data also confirm this finding, describing a high frequency of all types of diarrheal illness among returned travelers. 7 A history of insect bite or unexplained soft tissue infection or abscess should prompt the clinician to consider vector-borne illness. Malaria, as previously noted, has historically been the most common cause of febrile illness in returned travelers requiring hospitalization. The diagnosis of malaria should be considered even in patients without a clear history of mosquito exposure and in those who have taken appropriate malaria chemoprophylaxis. A missed or delayed diagnosis of malaria can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Because of its high incidence among returned travelers, thick and thin blood smears for malaria should be obtained for any febrile patient who has had recent travel to areas where malaria is endemic, especially, sub-Saharan Africa, Central and South America and Southeast Asia. Other vector-borne diseases which may present with fever include dengue, yellow fever, rickettsial diseases such as African tick fever, and trypanosomiasis. A history of yellow fever vaccination, required by many countries prior to travel to endemic areas, makes the disease much less likely, although it cannot be entirely excluded. Also, vaccination histories may be inaccurate. 8\\n\\nFever duration and pattern\\n\\nInformation regarding the time course of the patient's fever is also helpful in excluding certain diseases. Incubation periods shorter than 21 days are typical for dengue, viral hemorrhagic fevers, typhoid fever and yellow fever. Incubation times greater than 21 days are seen in tuberculosis, amebic liver abscess, rabies and leishmaniasis. While an incubation period of 21 days is generally seen in acute HIV infection, the onset of HIV seroconversion illness may vary considerably. 9 Similarly, malaria can present with fever of variable onset, with more delayed presentations seen in patients taking ineffective prophylaxis. Fever patterns, although often non-specific, may suggest certain etiologies. Periodic fever spikes, long considered characteristic of malaria, may take some time to become established, limiting their utility in the diagnosis of early disease. Continuous presence of fever is more common in rickettsial infections or typhoid fever. 6\\n\\nPhysical examination\\n\\nThe presence of specific physical examination findings in the returned traveler can provide additional diagnostic clues. The presence of a maculopapular rash, while seen in many relatively innocuous clinical entities such as drug eruption or viral exanthem, may also indicate the presence of more serious pathology, including dengue fever, leptospirosis or typhus. \\n\\nDiagnostic testing\\n\\nThe initial diagnostic evaluation for these patients should focus on identifying routine, treatable illnesses as well as high risk occult infections. Complete blood count with differential, chemistry panel, hepatic enzyme profile, blood cultures, urinalysis and urine culture should be part of the initial screening tests. While these basic laboratory tests are unlikely to yield a definitive diagnosis, they may be useful in detecting more subtle abnormalities such as eosinophilia in parasitic infection or underlying metabolic disorders. Thick and thin blood smears for malaria should be obtained for travelers to tropical regions, and stool studies including stool culture, fecal leukocytes, ova and parasite assays should be ordered for patients complaining of diarrheal illness. Serum samples should be drawn and set aside for subsequent testing if rickettsial or arboviral diseases are a consideration. 6 Comparison of acute phase antibody titers to subsequent, convalescent phase assays can be useful in tracking the course of a disease. In the rare situation where patients are suspected of harboring highly pathogenic illnesses such as hemorrhagic fever viruses, plague or anthrax, all specimens from such patients should be regarded as high risk. Laboratory personnel who may be handling these specimens should be notified before processing any sample so that tests may be carried out without risk of transmission of infection to laboratory personnel. Refer definitive testing for suspected high risk pathogens such as hemorrhagic fever viruses, anthrax or tularemia to specialized reference laboratories equipped to handle these agents.\\n\\nDecontamination and isolation\\n\\nParticularly for high risk infectious agents, the subject of decontamination and isolation becomes increasingly important. While most diseases that may be present in returned travelers require only the implementation of routine universal precautions, some of the more virulent pathogens may require the clinician and treating health care team to adopt more strict infection control measures. In patients with suspected VHF infection, the use of impermeable gowns, N-95 masks, face shields or goggles, as well as negative-pressure isolation rooms with dedicated medical equipment for each patient (such as stethoscopes and blood pressure cuffs) is imperative, as is the restriction of access by nonessential staff and visitors. 10 These precautions also apply to other airborne illnesses that carry significant potential risk for staff or patientepatient transmission such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. Patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis infection may be managed with standard airborne precautions.\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nTreatment regimens for ill returned travelers should initially center on high risk tropical diseases such as malaria, as well as common clinical entities including pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infection. Failure to consider the diagnosis of malaria or to institute prompt therapy may be a potentially fatal error. Empiric antibiotic coverage with fluoroquinolones should be instituted for travelers presenting with fever and diarrheal illness, particularly if bloody diarrhea is present. Bloody diarrhea and the presence of fecal leukocytes are more associated with invasive infections such as salmonellosis or shigellosis. More specific anti-infective therapies for such illnesses as malaria, rickettsial infection or typhoid fever should be instituted only after initial investigations or clinical findings suggest these etiologies. While patients with mild illness may be managed as outpatients, suspected infection with highly virulent or rare tropical diseases should mandate inpatient hospitalization to allow further investigation and consultation with infectious disease specialists.\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nPatients presenting to an emergency department or other health care setting with febrile illness after recent travel may harbor a daunting array of illnesses, some of which may have even predated their travel, while others may be acquired in virtually any geographic region worldwide. Knowing the most likely infectious diseases that a traveler might encounter on a given trip to Africa, Central or South America or the Middle East is an important first step in determining the proper evaluation and management strategy for a given febrile returned traveler. Screening questions that identify time of onset of fever, specific locations and durations of travel as well as high risk exposures, such as encounters with ill individuals or rural settings, can rapidly exclude certain diseases from the differential diagnosis. Subsequent diagnostic efforts should attempt to exclude the most common tropical diseases such as malaria, dengue, and food-borne illnesses along with more routine viral and bacterial illnesses. Patients who are suspected of carrying highly pathogenic organisms such as viral hemorrhagic fevers, anthrax, plague, and tularemia should be managed with special attention paid to issues of decontamination, isolation and biocontainment. A concise evaluation and management strategy for the ill traveler based on careful consideration of possible diagnoses and the prompt institution of appropriate therapies for tropical illnesses is essential, as the potential for morbidity and mortality in ill travelers who suffer missed or delayed diagnosis may be significant.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Introduction\\n\\nThe influenza pandemic of 1918-1919, which contributed to an estimated 50 million deaths worldwide, stimulated interest in influenza vaccine research [1] . Twenty years after the pandemic began, the first influenza vaccine was administered to US soldiers in 1938 [1] . From the 2010-2011 influenza season to the 2017-2018 season, excluding for the 2014-2015 season, the influenza vaccine was shown to be effective at reducing the burden of seasonal influenza in the United States [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] .While influenza vaccination offers protection against influenza, natural influenza infection may reduce the risk of non-influenza respiratory viruses by providing temporary, non-specific immunity against these viruses [7, 8] . On the other hand, recently published studies have described the phenomenon of vaccine-associated virus interference; that is, vaccinated individuals may be at increased risk for other respiratory viruses because they do not receive the non-specific immunity associated with natural infection [7] [8] [9] [10] . There has been limited evidence that the influenza vaccine may actually be associated with the virus interference process [8, 11] . Other studies have found no association between influenza vaccination and increased respiratory virus risk [10, 12] .The purpose of this study is to add to the general knowledge of influenza vaccine-related virus interference by comparing rates of https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019. 10 [13] . This study aims to examine the relationship between specific respiratory viruses and influenza vaccination. The protocol for this study was reviewed and approved as exempt by the Air Force Research Laboratory Institutional Review Board.\\n\\nMaterials and methods\\n\\nThe Department of Defense Global Respiratory Pathogen Surveillance Program (DoDGRS) is a DoD-wide program established by the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (GEIS). The program was founded in 1997 as an influenza-only surveillance program. In the 2013-2014 influenza season the program added respiratory Film Array for flu negative samples and began identifying other respiratory pathogens. Starting in the 2017-2018 influenza season, the program added Luminex Film Array capabilities to test for respiratory pathogens, and became known as DoDGRS. The Defense Health Agency/Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch -Air Force Satellite Cell (DHA/ AFHSB -AF) and United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) manage the surveillance program that includes global surveillance among DoD beneficiaries at 79 sentinel sites (including deployed locations) and many non-sentinel sites. Laboratory testing completed at USAFSAM and Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) included multiplex PCR respiratory pathogen panels (including: adenovirus, Chlmydia pneumoniae, coronavirus, human bocavirus, human metapnumovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus/enterovirus, and co-infections) [14, 15] , viral culture detecting influenza and other respiratory viruses, and influenza A/B subtyping via PCR [16, 17] . Vaccination status was derived from both the Air Force Complete Immunization Tracking Application (AFCITA), a United States Air Force database containing vaccination-related data, and from surveys given to those submitting respiratory samples. If the patient had an influenza vaccination record in AFCITA for the 2017-2018 influenza season, or answered yes to being vaccinated during the season on their survey, they were identified as vaccinated. Patients who were not vaccinated for the season or who were vaccinated less than 14 days prior to specimen submittal were classified as unvaccinated.All people submitting a respiratory specimen to the DoDGRS for the 2017-2018 influenza season were eligible for the study. The influenza season began 1 October 2017 and ended 29 September 2018. Those who submitted a sample and only tested positive for Chlamydia pneumoniae and/or Mycoplasma pneumoniae were excluded because these illnesses are bacteriological in nature, not viral. People with influenza and non-influenza coinfections were excluded because they could not be uniquely classified as either influenza or non-influenza respiratory virus. Individuals with multiple specimens collected during the season were also removed from the study as they could have had multiple different viruses over the season. Specimens where neither vaccination status could be obtained via databases nor a questionnaire was completed were excluded because vaccination status could not be confirmed. Subjects who were ill before receiving vaccination were excluded as vaccination status would therefore be unrelated to illness. Lastly, those people for whom the laboratory rejected the specimen were not included in the final study population.Data management and statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 and SAS Enterprise Guide 7.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Basic descriptive epidemiology was utilized to obtain counts and rates of outcomes by sex, military beneficiary category, age group, disease status, seasonality of illness, and vaccination status. In order to determine if virus interference was associated with influenza vaccination in the military beneficiary population, odds ratios and confidence intervals were calculated utilizing conditional logistic regression to compare vaccination status from two analyses. First, those with a viral respiratory illness other than influenza were compared to those with no pathogen detected (pan-negative). Next influenza positive cases were compared to three different control groups. The first control group was comprised of all controls, specifically, individuals testing negative for flu or positive for any respiratory virus other than flu. The second control group consisted of only those who were positive for respiratory viruses other than influenza. Lastly, pan-negative controls were compared to influenza cases. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were calculated for the overall population, the population with AFCITA records only, and the active duty only population during the influenza season for the comparison of other respiratory illnesses to pan-negatives, as well as all three case-control comparisons. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated after modeling variables in a nested logistic regression, keeping all variables with p < 0.20 and then adding them to a full logistic model. In the full logistic model, only variables that remained significant were included in the final adjusted model. Age group remained significant in the overall population; age group and seasonality remained significant in the AFCITA confirmed vaccination group and the Active Duty population; and gender, age group, and seasonality all remained significant in all three of the case-control comparisons. Those respective variables that remained significant were included in the adjustment for the odds ratio for the total season. Individual respiratory virus outcomes were also examined and stratified by vaccination status. Odds ratios, confidence intervals, and p-values were calculated to determine if individual respiratory viruses were associated with influenza vaccination.\\n\\nResults\\n\\nFor the 2017-2018 influenza season, 4041 out of 11,943 specimens tested positive for influenza (33.8%) (Data not shown). There were 3869 specimens identified as other respiratory pathogens (32.4%). The remaining 4033 specimens resulted as negative (33.8%) (Data not shown). Of the 11,943 specimens, 2474 (20.7%) specimens were excluded from our population based on the exclusionary criteria described in the Methods section, leaving a final study population of 9469 unique people (Data not shown). The study population was predominantly male, Active Duty service members, aged 18-35 years old (Tables 1 and 2) . A majority of the study population was vaccinated (Tables 1 and 2 ). Most respiratory specimens were analyzed during the winter (December, January, and February) months (Tables 1 and 2) .Those who tested positive for a respiratory virus other than influenza had a similar breakdown for sex, vaccination status, and season of illness when compared to pan-negatives ( Table 1) . The other respiratory positive group had more child beneficiaries, and was overall younger than the pan-negative group (Table 1) . Examining demographic characteristics stratified by vaccination status, males were more likely to be vaccinated than females (Table 2) . Active Duty members were more likely to be vaccinated than people with other beneficiary statuses ( Table 2 ). The younger aged population was more likely to be unvaccinated when compared to other age groups ( Table 2 ). Composition of lab results (Other respiratory virus, influenza, and no pathogen detected) was distributed fairly evenly among the vaccinated population; however, unvaccinated people were more likely to have their specimen resulted as influenza (Table 2) . Winter was the predominate season for illness and specimen testing ( Table 2) . Among the study population, 4549 people had AFCITA vaccination records (48.0%) while 4920 people self-reported vaccination status via questionnaire (52.0%) (Data not shown).Examining the population with other respiratory viruses and no virus detected, those who were vaccinated had 19% lower unadjusted odds (95% CI: 0.72, 0.91) of having other respiratory viruses compared to those who were unvaccinated (Table 3) . After adjusting for age group, the odds were 3% lower (95% CI: 0.86, 1.09) of having other respiratory viruses in the vaccinated population ( Table 3 ). The unadjusted (data not shown) were statistically significant; however, the adjusted odds did not remain statistically significant (p = 0.60) ( Table 3 ). Since self-reported vaccination status may not be accurate and may bias results, those with AFCITA confirmed vaccination were examined exclusively. Those who were vaccinated according AFCITA records had 5% lower unadjusted odds (95% CI: 0.68, 1.34) of having other respiratory viruses compared to those who were unvaccinated (Table 3) . Adjusting for age group and seasonality increased the odds to 23% higher (95% CI: 0.86, 1.76) of having other respiratory viruses in the vaccinated population (Table 3) . Neither the unadjusted odds (data not shown) nor the adjusted odds (p = 0.24) in the AFCITA population were significant. Virus interference was also examined among Active Duty only for the 2017-2018 season. Those who were vaccinated had slightly lower unadjusted odds (OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.73, 1.29) of having other respiratory viruses compared to those who were unvaccinated (Table 3 ). After adjusting for age and season, these odds increased to a 20% higher odds (95% CI: 0.89, 1.61) of having other respiratory viruses in the vaccinated population; however, the unadjusted (data not shown) and adjusted (p = 0.24) odds ratios were not statistically significant (Table 3) .Both the unadjusted and adjusted odds of influenza were significantly lower in the vaccinated population for all three of the control groups ( Table 4 ). The adjusted ORs ranged from 0.46 (pan-negative comparison) to 0.51 (non-influenza virus positive comparison) ( Table 4 ). The 95% CI for the adjusted ORs of all three comparison groups overlapped and no differences were detected among each control group when compared to influenza cases.The odds of testing positive for individual respiratory viruses by vaccination status were also examined ( Table 5 ). The influenza vaccine was sufficient at protecting all influenza virus results tested for at a significant level except two (Influenza B Victoria and Influenza coinfections) ( Table 5 ). Both Influenza B Victoria and Influenza coinfections had reduced odds in the vaccinated cohort, but not at significant levels (Table 5 ). Examining noninfluenza viruses specifically, the odds of both coronavirus and human metapneumovirus in vaccinated individuals were significantly higher when compared to unvaccinated individuals (OR = 1.36 and 1.51, respectively) ( Table 5) . Conversely, all other non-influenza respiratory viruses had decreased odds in the vaccinated population, including significantly decreased odds ratios in vaccinated people with parainfluenza, RSV, and non-influenza virus coinfections (Table 5) . Additionally, the odds ratio in the no pathogen detected cohort was significantly higher in vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals (OR = 1.51) ( Table 5) .\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nExamining 6120 people with respiratory viruses other than influenza and pan-negative results who submitted a respiratory specimen for laboratory testing to the DoDGRS team, those who received an influenza vaccine had a decreased risk of having other respiratory pathogens identified compared to the unvaccinated group. One study in the United States found similar results [12] . The study found influenza vaccination was not associated with detection of non-influenza respiratory viruses [12] . Additionally, the laboratory data in our study showed increased odds of coronavirus and human metapneumovirus in individuals receiving influenza vaccination. The study finding similar results to our study found no association between influenza vaccination and RSV, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus or coronavirus [12] . The same study did find a significant association between parainfluenza and influenza vaccination, but the association was in opposite directions when comparing children and adults [12] . In our disease specific investigation, virus interference trends were noticed for coronavirus and human metapneumovirus; however, two specific respiratory viruses (parainfluenza and RSV) showed significant protection associated with influenza vaccine receipt, and all others tested (adenovirus, human bocavirus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus) showed protection, although non-significant, associated with vaccination (Table 5) . Additional examination of virus interference was accomplished by assessing the affect that three non-influenza control groups had on vaccine effectiveness (N = 9469). The adjusted ORs for the three groups ranged from 0.46 to 0.51, having similar 95% confidence intervals, and accounting for a difference of 5% in vaccine effectiveness. The minute differences among the vaccine effectiveness of all three control groups does not support the virus interference concept.Test-negative study designs are often utilized to calculate influenza vaccine effectiveness. This type of study recruits subjects who have influenza-like illness, collects a respiratory specimen, performs diagnostic laboratory testing to determine the pathogen, and obtains the individual's vaccination status [18] [19] [20] [21] . The vaccine-associated virus interference phenomenon goes against the basic assumption of the test-negative vaccine effectiveness study, that is, vaccination does not change the risk of infection with other respiratory illness. The results of this study do not support a potential for bias in test-negative influenza vaccine effectiveness studies. In a test-negative study design, patients must be sick with influenza-like illness. Since the population must be ill, if the vaccinated population is more likely to have other respiratory viruses when compared to the non-vaccinated population, then in turn they are less likely to have influenza. Bias introduced in these studies may cause an overestimate of vaccine effectiveness. Mandatory influenza vaccination is required for all Active Duty personnel [13] . As such, vaccination effectiveness studies examining strictly Active Duty military members have previously shown to be methodologically invalid and often times have uninterpretable results [22, 23] . In order to examine potential issues with mandatory vaccination, beneficiary category was included in the logistic regression model. While beneficiary category did not remain significant, and was therefore not kept in the final logistic model, Active Duty members were then separated from the rest of the population and virus interference among this population was calculated. Both the unadjusted and adjusted models did not show significant evidence of virus interference in Active Duty members; therefore, this large portion of the population does not appear to be skewing study results converse to the aforementioned vaccine effectiveness studies.Study limitations include the assumption of a causal relationship between influenza vaccination and respiratory viruses. Perhaps there were other factors influencing rates of respiratory illnesses. Adjustment in the conditional logistic regression analysis attempted to account for some factors which could influence respiratory outcome. Additionally our study relied on self-reported vaccination status when data were unavailable in AFCITA. Missing vaccination status was especially high in non-Active Duty members of our study, as many of these patients were seen at clinics off base, and therefore not necessarily tracked in AFCITA. However, self-reported vaccination data were included to augment vaccination status when AFCITA data were unavailable. Self-reported data were assumed to be relatively accurate. To ensure self-reported data were not skewing findings, those with AFCITA records were examined exclusively for virus interference. Both the unadjusted and adjusted models did not show significant evidence of virus interference in AFCITA vaccinated personnel; therefore, vaccination record status does not appear to be skewing study results.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nVirus interference associated with influenza vaccination has been previously investigated [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . However, this study was the first virus interference study conducted among highly vaccinated DoD personnel. The study included a diverse, well dispersed population based on sex, age group, beneficiary category, and vaccination status. Additionally the population size was relatively large, and numerous respiratory pathogens were examined which were not previously individually investigated for virus interference.The overall results of the study showed little to no evidence supporting the association of virus interference and influenza vaccination. Individual respiratory virus results were mixed, and some rebutted virus interference. Additionally those receiving the influenza vaccine were more likely to have no pathogen detected and reduced risk of influenza when compared to unvaccinated individuals. Further research is necessary to help character virus interference and validate or refute the validity of the test-negative design for influenza vaccine effectiveness.\\n\\nDisclaimer\\n\\nThe views

Among the major viral causative agents of ARI are influenza A and B viruses and the respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs) A and B (Stockton et al., 1998) . Rapid diagnosis of these viral pathogens is important for determining appropriate clinical intervention and for monitoring these or related viruses during outbreaks or pandemic of emerging pathogens.A number of techniques are available for detection and characterization of influenza viruses and RSV including conventional methods such as cell culture, enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and immunofluorescence (IF) . Recent advances in molecular techniques enable detection of pathogens based on the nucleic acid sequences of genetic material isolated from viruses or bacteria in clinical specimens. Notably, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular methods have been used widely and are well accepted for laboratory diagnosis of pathogens due to their rapidity, sensitivity and high throughput capability (Fredricks and Relman, 1999; Louie et al., 2000; Weinberg et al., 2002; Yang and Rothman, 2004) . In the past few years, several multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) methods have been developed for the detection of influenza viruses, RSV and parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), etc. (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Coiras et al., 2003; Grondahl et al., 1999; Stockton et al., 1998; Syrmis et al., 2004) . In these methods, analysis of PCR products relies either on agarose gel electrophoresis or more time-consuming enzyme-linked assays and many of them include a nested PCR step to enhance sensitivity. However, none of the published methods provide quantitative results. More recently, real-time RT-PCR assays for detecting influenza and RSV have been developed and used successfully in testing clinical specimens (Boivin et al., 2004) .Here, we report on the development of a rapid, specific, and sensitive mRT-PCR method for simultaneous detection of influenza A/H1, A/H3 or B and RSV A/B. The primers for influenza A viruses were selected from the nucleotide sequences encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) gene as follows: for A/H1 subtype, 5 -atgcagacacaatatgtataggc-3 (HA1-forward [F]) and 5 -gatactgagctcaattgctc-3 (HA1-reverse [R]); for A/H3 subtype, 5 -gagctggttcagagttcctc-3 (HA3-F) and 5 -gtgacctaagggaggcataatc-3 (HA3-R). The primers for influenza B viruses were selected from the nucleotide sequences encoding the nucleoprotein (NP) gene as follows: 5 -gaagtaggtggagacggaggg-3 (NP-F) and 5 -gtaaacacccacattccaaacg-3 (NP-R). The primers for RSV were selected from the nucleotide sequences encoding the nucleocapsid protein (NP) gene as follows: for RSV-A, 5 -cagaggtacaccgaggaatcaa-3 (RSVANP-F) and 5 -gctgatgtttgatagcctct-3 (RSVANP-R); for RSV-B, 5 -tagaggtacgccaagaaaccag-3 (RSVBNP-F) and 5 -gttgattctttatggcttcc-3 (RSVBNP-R). The PCR assay was evaluated by testing primer pairs against various laboratory virus stocks. Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from 70 l influenza and RSV virus stocks or respiratory specimens using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Viral particle counts were determined by electron microscopy (Advanced Biotechnologies Inc., Columbia, MD) as previously described (Hu et al., 2003) . Multiplex RT-PCR was carried out in a 9600 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) using the Titan One Tube RT-PCR kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) in a total volume of 50 l with 5 l RNA and 2 l master primer mix. The master primer mix comprised 75 l A/H1, 50 l A/H3, 60 l B, 50 l RSV-A and 50 l RSV-B primers (including both forward and reverse sequences). All stock primer concentrations were 160 ng/ml. The PCR program was 48 • C for 15 min, 52 • C for 30 min and 94 • C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 • C for 1 min, 60 • C for 30 s and 68 • C for 1 min. Final extension was carried out at 68 • C for 5 min. The amplification products were analyzed by DNA 500 LabChip using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, 1 l PCR reaction was loaded into one of 12 sample wells on a LabChip containing 5 l DNA 500 Markers and run for 30 min under appropriate settings.To evaluate specificity and sensitivity, the following virus stocks with known particle numbers were used as positive controls: A/H1N1/New Caledonia, 3.6 × 10 9 /ml; A/H3N2/Panama, 2.1 × 10 9 /ml; B/Johannesburg, 1.8 × 10 9 /ml; RSV A2, 7.6 × 10 8 /ml; RSV 2B, 1.02 × 10 9 /ml. Fig. 1 shows the DNA 500 LabChip analysis of the mRT-PCR products with various combinations of the viruses. Non-specific PCR products were not observed. In addition, the sensitivity of the RT-PCR was evaluated by performing PCR in duplicate for each type of viral RNA independently. For these stocks, the minimal number of viral particles detected in the assay were equivalent to: A/H1N1, 2.1 × 10 3 ; A/H3N2, 1.2 × 10 3 ; B, 1.1 × 10 3 ; RSV A, 4.4 × 10; RSV B, 6.0 × 10 3 , respectively (data not shown).This mRT-PCR assay was utilized to evaluate 56 nasal swab specimens obtained from Asian children (6-36 months old) with respiratory symptoms, who were enrolled in an experimental influenza vaccine trial conducted in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and India during the winter of 2000 and 2001. Among these specimens, the mRT-PCR detected 10 influenza A/H1, 6 influenza A/H3, 8 influenza B positive and 1 RSV (A/B) positive sample (Table 1) , whereas culture confirmation identified 14 influenza A and 7 influenza B positive samples. No RSV culture was performed for these specimens. The PCR detected all culture-positive specimens with the additional benefit of distinguishing A/H1 and A/H3 subtypes. In addition, three culturenegative samples tested positive by the mRT-PCR method, one each from influenza A/H1, A/H3 and B groups, respectively. Despite the relatively small sample size, we further validated the results using a real-time RT-PCR assay performed on the same specimens. The results confirmed all the PCR positives and showed that compared with the culture-positive specimens, the three culture-negative specimens that were positive by PCR contained relatively low copy numbers of the viruses, ranging from 22 to 721 copies per reaction (data not shown). Respiratory viruses are conventionally diagnosed based on cell culture or antigen detection such as EIA and IF, which can be time-consuming or have limitations in sensitivity and specificity. Although real-time PCR may have higher sensitivity than conventional PCR, the latter is usually more economical for clinical laboratories that are not equipped with expensive realtime PCR instruments. In addition, the optimal of multiplicity for real-time PCR is currently limited to three due to a limited number of fluorophores (S. Cheng, unpublished). The method reported in this study, which primarily targets influenza A/H3, A/H1 and B viruses and RSV A and B, is carried out in a singlestep reaction with minimal opportunity for contamination since no secondary or tertiary nested PCR is needed as in previous methods (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Coiras et al., 2003; Grondahl et al., 1999; Stockton et al., 1998) . The PCR amplicons in this method range from 133 to 390 bp, which are relatively small in size that can increase the assay sensitivities. For analyzing PCR products, the DNA LabChip platform of Agilent Technologies was utilized to replace conventional agarose gel electrophoresis or more time-consuming enzyme-linked hybridization assays. The LabChip assay not only consumes smaller sample volumes (1 l per reaction) but also enhances sensitivity to as low as 0.5 ng/ l DNA. The LabChip provides unambiguous, consistent and semi-quantitative results, which permits ease of quality control and quantity estimation for any downstream analysis, such as DNA sequencing for strain determination. It also provides information such as relative abundance of viruses in the case of mixed infections. Our results showed that the mRT-PCR assay could easily detect specimens containing low virus copy numbers as well as cases of virus co-infection (e.g. 2 cases of A/H1 and A/H3 and 2 instances of A/H1 and B), which were not detected by culture confirmation. One of the limitation of this method is that the size of the PCR products for RSV A and B are not distinguishable; however, a separate assay designed to address this limitation was developed later (Hu et al., 2003) .In conclusion, our mRT-PCR provides a rapid, sensitive and semiquantitative tool for the detection and typing/subtyping of influenza viruses and RSV, and can be applied to screen respiratory illness specimens obtained from patients with similar clinical respiratory symptoms. The assay can be easily performed by local laboratories for determination of the causative viral agent(s) of respiratory illness during suspected outbreaks of newly emerging pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, and potential avian flu H5N1 virus, by eliminating common viral pathogens, thus facilitating local disease management and global surveillance.\\n\\n\",\n"," 'ARTICLE_SUBMITTED': \"\\n\\nAcute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) are the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in young children, the elderly and immune-compromised patients worldwide (Boivin et al., 2004; Hinman, 1998) . Among the major viral causative agents of ARI are influenza A and B viruses and the respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs) A and B (Stockton et al., 1998) . Rapid diagnosis of these viral pathogens is important for determining appropriate clinical intervention and for monitoring these or related viruses during outbreaks or pandemic of emerging pathogens.A number of techniques are available for detection and characterization of influenza viruses and RSV including conventional methods such as cell culture, enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and immunofluorescence (IF) . Recent advances in molecular techniques enable detection of pathogens based on the nucleic acid sequences of genetic material isolated from viruses or bacteria in clinical specimens. Notably, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular methods have been used widely and are well accepted for laboratory diagnosis of pathogens due to their rapidity, sensitivity and high throughput capability (Fredricks and Relman, 1999; Louie et al., 2000; Weinberg et al., 2002; Yang and Rothman, 2004) . In the past few years, several multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) methods have been developed for the detection of influenza viruses, RSV and parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), etc. (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Coiras et al., 2003; Grondahl et al., 1999; Stockton et al., 1998; Syrmis et al., 2004) . In these methods, analysis of PCR products relies either on agarose gel electrophoresis or more time-consuming enzyme-linked assays and many of them include a nested PCR step to enhance sensitivity. However, none of the published methods provide quantitative results. More recently, real-time RT-PCR assays for detecting influenza and RSV have been developed and used successfully in testing clinical specimens (Boivin et al., 2004) .Here, we report on the development of a rapid, specific, and sensitive mRT-PCR method for simultaneous detection of influenza A/H1, A/H3 or B and RSV A/B. The primers for influenza A viruses were selected from the nucleotide sequences encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) gene as follows: for A/H1 subtype, 5 -atgcagacacaatatgtataggc-3 (HA1-forward [F]) and 5 -gatactgagctcaattgctc-3 (HA1-reverse [R]); for A/H3 subtype, 5 -gagctggttcagagttcctc-3 (HA3-F) and 5 -gtgacctaagggaggcataatc-3 (HA3-R). The primers for influenza B viruses were selected from the nucleotide sequences encoding the nucleoprotein (NP) gene as follows: 5 -gaagtaggtggagacggaggg-3 (NP-F) and 5 -gtaaacacccacattccaaacg-3 (NP-R). The primers for RSV were selected from the nucleotide sequences encoding the nucleocapsid protein (NP) gene as follows: for RSV-A, 5 -cagaggtacaccgaggaatcaa-3 (RSVANP-F) and 5 -gctgatgtttgatagcctct-3 (RSVANP-R); for RSV-B, 5 -tagaggtacgccaagaaaccag-3 (RSVBNP-F) and 5 -gttgattctttatggcttcc-3 (RSVBNP-R). The PCR assay was evaluated by testing primer pairs against various laboratory virus stocks. Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from 70 l influenza and RSV virus stocks or respiratory specimens using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Viral particle counts were determined by electron microscopy (Advanced Biotechnologies Inc., Columbia, MD) as previously described (Hu et al., 2003) . Multiplex RT-PCR was carried out in a 9600 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) using the Titan One Tube RT-PCR kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) in a total volume of 50 l with 5 l RNA and 2 l master primer mix. The master primer mix comprised 75 l A/H1, 50 l A/H3, 60 l B, 50 l RSV-A and 50 l RSV-B primers (including both forward and reverse sequences). All stock primer concentrations were 160 ng/ml. The PCR program was 48 • C for 15 min, 52 • C for 30 min and 94 • C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 • C for 1 min, 60 • C for 30 s and 68 • C for 1 min. Final extension was carried out at 68 • C for 5 min. The amplification products were analyzed by DNA 500 LabChip using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, 1 l PCR reaction was loaded into one of 12 sample wells on a LabChip containing 5 l DNA 500 Markers and run for 30 min under appropriate settings.To evaluate specificity and sensitivity, the following virus stocks with known particle numbers were used as positive controls: A/H1N1/New Caledonia, 3.6 × 10 9 /ml; A/H3N2/Panama, 2.1 × 10 9 /ml; B/Johannesburg, 1.8 × 10 9 /ml; RSV A2, 7.6 × 10 8 /ml; RSV 2B, 1.02 × 10 9 /ml. Fig. 1 shows the DNA 500 LabChip analysis of the mRT-PCR products with various combinations of the viruses. Non-specific PCR products were not observed. In addition, the sensitivity of the RT-PCR was evaluated by performing PCR in duplicate for each type of viral RNA independently. For these stocks, the minimal number of viral particles detected in the assay were equivalent to: A/H1N1, 2.1 × 10 3 ; A/H3N2, 1.2 × 10 3 ; B, 1.1 × 10 3 ; RSV A, 4.4 × 10; RSV B, 6.0 × 10 3 , respectively (data not shown).This mRT-PCR assay was utilized to evaluate 56 nasal swab specimens obtained from Asian children (6-36 months old) with respiratory symptoms, who were enrolled in an experimental influenza vaccine trial conducted in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and India during the winter of 2000 and 2001. Among these specimens, the mRT-PCR detected 10 influenza A/H1, 6 influenza A/H3, 8 influenza B positive and 1 RSV (A/B) positive sample (Table 1) , whereas culture confirmation identified 14 influenza A and 7 influenza B positive samples. No RSV culture was performed for these specimens. The PCR detected all culture-positive specimens with the additional benefit of distinguishing A/H1 and A/H3 subtypes. In addition, three culturenegative samples tested positive by the mRT-PCR method, one each from influenza A/H1, A/H3 and B groups, respectively. Despite the relatively small sample size, we further validated the results using a real-time RT-PCR assay performed on the same specimens. The results confirmed all the PCR positives and showed that compared with the culture-positive specimens, the three culture-negative specimens that were positive by PCR contained relatively low copy numbers of the viruses, ranging from 22 to 721 copies per reaction (data not shown). Respiratory viruses are conventionally diagnosed based on cell culture or antigen detection such as EIA and IF, which can be time-consuming or have limitations in sensitivity and specificity. Although real-time PCR may have higher sensitivity than conventional PCR, the latter is usually more economical for clinical laboratories that are not equipped with expensive realtime PCR instruments. In addition, the optimal of multiplicity for real-time PCR is currently limited to three due to a limited number of fluorophores (S. Cheng, unpublished). The method reported in this study, which primarily targets influenza A/H3, A/H1 and B viruses and RSV A and B, is carried out in a singlestep reaction with minimal opportunity for contamination since no secondary or tertiary nested PCR is needed as in previous methods (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Coiras et al., 2003; Grondahl et al., 1999; Stockton et al., 1998) . The PCR amplicons in this method range from 133 to 390 bp, which are relatively small in size that can increase the assay sensitivities. For analyzing PCR products, the DNA LabChip platform of Agilent Technologies was utilized to replace conventional agarose gel electrophoresis or more time-consuming enzyme-linked hybridization assays. The LabChip assay not only consumes smaller sample volumes (1 l per reaction) but also enhances sensitivity to as low as 0.5 ng/ l DNA. The LabChip provides unambiguous, consistent and semi-quantitative results, which permits ease of quality control and quantity estimation for any downstream analysis, such as DNA sequencing for strain determination. It also provides information such as relative abundance of viruses in the case of mixed infections. Our results showed that the mRT-PCR assay could easily detect specimens containing low virus copy numbers as well as cases of virus co-infection (e.g. 2 cases of A/H1 and A/H3 and 2 instances of A/H1 and B), which were not detected by culture confirmation. One of the limitation of this method is that the size of the PCR products for RSV A and B are not distinguishable; however, a separate assay designed to address this limitation was developed later (Hu et al., 2003) .In conclusion, our mRT-PCR provides a rapid, sensitive and semiquantitative tool for the detection and typing/subtyping of influenza viruses and RSV, and can be applied to screen respiratory illness specimens obtained from patients with similar clinical respiratory symptoms. The assay can be easily performed by local laboratories for determination of the causative viral agent(s) of respiratory illness during suspected outbreaks of newly emerging pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, and potential avian flu H5N1 virus, by eliminating common viral pathogens, thus facilitating local disease management and global surveillance.\\n\\n\"}"]},"execution_count":176,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["analysis_result"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"qzjceD0r8U9w"},"outputs":[],"source":["french_article_to_check = \"\"\"\n","Les Réseaux d’Innovation et de Transfert Agricole (RITA) ont été créés en 2011 pour\n"," mieux connecter la recherche et le développement agricole, intra et inter-DOM, avec un objectif d’accompagnement de\n"," la diversification des productions locales.

The eight goals address targets to increase incomes; reduce hunger; achieve universal primary education; eliminate gender inequality; reduce maternal and child mortality; reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; reverse the loss of natural resources and biodiversity; improve access to water, sanitation, and good housing; and establish eff ective global partnerships. Progress in some goals has been impressive; however, global targets will not be met in some regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. As we approach the 2015 target date, there is considerable interest in assessment of the present goals and in consideration of the future of development goals after 2015.This Commission has brought together sectoral experts on diff erent MDGs from the London International Development Centre to identify cross-cutting challenges that have emerged from MDG implementation so far. This interdisciplinary approach diff ers from previous MDG studies that have either examined individual goals or made broad sociopolitical assessments of the MDGs as a development mechanism. We used our analysis of crosscutting challenges as the basis to identify a set of principles for future goal development, after 2015. We emphasise that this report is not an assessment of the MDGs; we focus deliberately on challenges with the implementation of the MDGs so as to inform future goal setting.The MDGs are an assembly of sector-specifi c and often quite narrowly focused targets that have their various origins in development ideas and campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s. They were not derived from an inclusive analysis and prioritisation of development needs, and this is refl ected in the absence from them of a range of key development issues. The variable progress recorded with goals and targets partly indicates a tendency over time to focus on a subset of targets that have proven easier to implement and monitor, or which have stronger ownership by international or national institutions, or both. Complexity and lack of ownership have been particular problems for new targets added later in the MDG process. We provide short analyses of each MDG for those seeking more depth and to set out the evidence for a cross-MDG analysis (webappendix).Clearly the MDGs have had notable success in encouraging global political consensus, providing a focus\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) emerged from the United Nations (UN) Millennium Declaration in 2000, and are arguably the most politically important pact ever made for international development. 1 They identify specifi c development priorities across a very broad range, including poverty, education, gender, health, environment, and international partnerships. These goals have substantially shaped development dialogue and investment; some development agencies judge all their activities on the contribution to achievement of the MDGs. 2 Overall, progress towards the MDGs has been described as \"patchy\" 3 and \"uneven\". 4 The broad conclusion is that few goals are entirely on track globally, and those that are show substantial variation, with least progress in Africa and often south Asia. Whereas MDG 1 (eradication of extreme poverty and hunger) is on course to be achieved and \"remarkable improvements\" have been made regarding aspects of MDG 6 (combating of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases), insuffi cient progress has been made towards achievement of MDG 2 (provision of universal primary education), MDG 4 (reduction of child mortality), and MDG 5 (reduction of maternal mortality). 4, 5 Steps towards MDG 3 (promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women) have been labelled \"sluggish\"; \"alarmingly high\" rates of deforestation are hampering MDG 7 (ensuring of environmental sustainability); and Africa is \"short-changed\" by the aid fl ows included under MDG 8 (development of a global partnership for development). 4 Moreover, the global economic crisis has accentuated the urgency of the discussion, and progress is being jeopardised because of new fi nancial constraints. 6 As we approach the two-thirds mark for the achievement of these goals in 2015, attention is focused on acceleration of progress, and on whether these goals are the right model for international development after 2015. So far, analysis of the MDGs as models for international development has taken two forms. The fi rst involves sector-specifi c assessment of progress towards individual MDGs, largely by sectoral experts. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The second involves broader analysis of the MDGs as instruments of development, largely by international development specialists. 3, 12, 13 We believe that an understanding of the MDGs and future improvements in goal setting benefi ts from consideration of all goals together, because they are so interconnected and because their individual implementation has identifi ed many common issues. The purpose of this report is to identify challenges that have emerged in delivery of the MDGs that are common to diff erent goals and to suggest how future goal setting can be improved to avoid these diffi culties. We do not undertake to present a verdict on the MDGs, or a balanced assessment weighing advantages and disadvantages. We focus deliberately on problems with the MDGs to identify See Online for webappendix better future approaches. We will not propose specifi c changes in MDGs after 2015, but will suggest a set of principles that might guide future goal development. This Commission is intended for a broad readership interested in all MDGs and for a more health-focused readership, who we hope will gain an improved understanding of the important relations between health and other MDG targets.We begin part 1 of our report with a brief introduction to the MDGs, which is accompanied by a webappendix presenting analyses of the development and implementation of each MDG. In part 2, we present a cross-cutting comparison and analysis of MDGs 1-7. We restrict our analysis to these seven MDGs because they share a focus, across very diff erent sectors, on action in and by developing countries, whereas MDG 8 is focused more on actions by wealthy countries. We derive from this analysis the common challenges facing the MDGs. In part 3, we use these challenges to develop and illustrate fi ve principles for future development goal setting, with health as a theme.\\n\\nThis Commission was undertaken at the request of\\n\\nThe Lancet by the London International Development Centre (LIDC)-a consortium of six University of London colleges (Birkbeck, Institute of Education, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, School of Oriental and African Studies, Royal Veterinary College, and the School of Pharmacy). LIDC is dedicated to novel, intersectoral, and interdisciplinary approaches to international development. The Commission was codesigned with The Lancet, coordinated by LIDC, and prepared by experts in three LIDC member institutions: the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Institute of Education, and School of Oriental and African Studies, and their research partners in South Africa, Zambia, Malawi, India, and Thailand. This team brought specifi c, individual expertise with MDGs 1-7, from diff erent development perspectives and backgrounds. To build a team approach, each expert was asked with her or his partners to write a critique of their MDG and to contribute ideas arising from this analysis towards the design of future development goals. All participants read these papers as preparation for a 2-day facilitated workshop that identifi ed issues and challenges that cut across the MDGs and built a consensus about future development goal setting. During four subsequent, smaller workshops, this consensus was developed into a fi nal document. Although overseas partners could participate only in the fi rst main workshop, all contributed towards subsequent development and have made contributions to the fi nal version, including specifi c case studies. Analyses of individual MDGs are provided (webappendix) for readers interested in more detail. They provide the evidence base for the crosscutting analysis.\\n\\nBackground to the MDGs\\n\\nThe MDGs comprise a set of eight goals and associated targets and indicators. They represent the latest eff ort in a long process of development goal setting which had antecedents in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Development Decade of the 1960s, and the many UN summits of the second half of the 20th century that set specifi c goals to reduce hunger, improve health, eradicate diseases, and school children. 14 The immediate antecedent of the MDGs was the Millennium Declaration, presented in 2000 at the UN Millennium Summit. 15 The Millennium Declaration presented six values that were considered to be fundamental to international relations in the 21st century: freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for nature, and shared responsibility. Seven key objectives were identifi ed to translate these shared values into actions: peace, security, and disarmament; development and poverty eradication; protection of our common environment; human rights, democracy, and good governance; protection of vulnerable people; meeting of the special needs of Africa; and strengthening of the UN. The second objective, development and poverty eradication, was translated into eleven resolutions, presented as development targets. Many of these targets had legacies that predated the Millennium Declaration and had arisen from sector-specifi c UN-sponsored and other world conferences and summits during the previous decades. Most had appeared as international development targets in the report of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Shaping the 21st century: the contribution of development cooperation. 16 The OECD\\'s international development targets were particularly infl uential in the determination of the relevant text of the Millennium Declaration. With the addition of a few more targets, particularly for environmental sustainability, these became the MDGs. In turn these targets were linked post hoc with indicators, for the purposes of measurement, and with goals, for the purpose of conceptual simplicity. By 2001 the MDG framework comprised eight goals, 18 targets, and 48 indicators. 17 A few more targets and indicators were added later, creating the set presented in panel 1.To understand the MDGs, the political context in which they arose has to be appreciated. Several recent analyses have provided a useful insight into how the MDGs represent an integration of diff erent international development strategies and initiatives emerging over recent decades. Hulme, 19 for instance, suggests that the MDGs developed through an interaction between, on the one hand, a US-led, neo-liberal ideology (one that promotes economic growth based on free trade and markets) linked to results-based management and, on the other hand, a development approach of some other wealthy countries, multilaterals, and non-governmental organisation (NGOs) that focused on multidimensional For more on the London International Development Centre see http://www.lidc. org.uk human development-eg, health, education, and gender equity, treating these as both development goals and development means. The emerging goals are biased towards a human development approach-\"fi ve and a half of the eight MDGs are about enhancing human capabilities\" 19 -and there is a strong emphasis on basic needs. However, they also incorporate neo-liberal thinking about economic growth into their important poverty goal (MDG 1), and their overall results-based framework focused greatly on international development partnerships. Manning 3 observes how the early neo-liberal leanings of the goals were tempered by recognition of the need for buy-in by developing countries and by NGOs, leading to the inclusion of goals more focused on human welfare and development, such as health and education.In addition to their integration of diff erent development challenges and approaches, the MDGs also provided a novel, target-oriented framework for the international development community. Gore 13 suggests that in tempering earlier neo-liberal approaches to development with human development objectives, the MDGs represent a switch from a \"procedural conception of international society\" to a \"purposive conception\". The former involves \"an association of States joined together through their common respect for a set of rules, norms and standard practices which govern the relationships between them\" whereas the latter involves \"an association of States joined together in a cooperative venture to promote common ends\". 13 With this target focus came an important shift from maximalist views of development (in which development involves poorer countries achieving aspirations of equality with richer countries) to minimalist standards (of proportions of people crossing poverty thresholds or accessing particular services or avoiding mortality or morbidity); and from societal and national change to changes for individuals within nation states. The emphasis on specifi c and minimalist targets, and the way in which it narrowed the development agenda and placed particular responsibilities on developing country governments, has generated many of the challenges facing implementation of the MDGs.Our study is based on the comparison of experiences across the diff erent MDGs. To facilitate this comparison, we provide analyses of each MDG: how it was developed, how it has been implemented, and what this information tells us about its success so far. This analysis is provided in the webappendix, which we recommend readers consult for a deeper understanding of MDG performance. We use the analyses of MDGs 1-7 as the evidence base for our analysis in part 2 of this Commission.These MDG analyses show that the MDGs and their targets all have their origins in development initiatives that predate the Millennium Declaration. For the most part, the MDGs constitute an assembly of often very narrowly focused and sector-specifi c development ideas and campaigns from the 1980s and 1990s. Their targets are often so narrow as to neglect important development issues in the same sector-eg, tertiary education, reproductive health, and a range of gender issues. At their conception, therefore, the MDGs were not a plan derived bottom-up from a broad, intersectoral conceptualisation of development and prioritisation of development needs, although superfi cially they might seem to have been. These summaries also show that progress has varied between goals and between targets. Although some goals were set up with a range of targets and indicators, subsequent attention and monitoring for any goal has usually focused on a subset of these targets and indicators, sometimes only one. This narrowing process could be an indication of diff erences in ease of target implementation and monitoring, and in the level of ownership by international and other institutions, with little ownership or overlap in ownership reducing progress. Generally, eff orts to improve MDGs by adding new targets at a later date have not been very successful, owing to the complexity of these targets and their indicators or to limited ownership, or both.\\n\\nPositive contributions of the MDGs\\n\\nIn this section, we use our studies of individual MDGs as the evidence base from which we build a cross-cutting analysis. When appropriate, we relate our conclusions to other reviews of the MDGs that have used a range of approaches. 2, 3, 12, 13, 15, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] The performance of individual MDGs so far suggests that they have made four important positive contributions: encouraging global political consensus, providing a focus for advocacy, improving the targeting and fl ow of aid, and improving the monitoring of development projects.Endorsed by 189 governments, the MDGs represent an unprecedented consensus on international development. In this context, they have been more successful than have some of the UN\\'s earlier development initiatives, such as the Development Decades of the 1960-90s or the resolutions about Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States. 3 In a 2005 survey of 118 countries, 86% had reportedly acted in response to the MDGs. 25 The MDGs are claimed to be \"the fi rst global development vision that combines a global political endorsement with a clear focus on, and means to engage directly with, the world\\'s poor people\". 1 The survey of individual MDGs (webappendix) shows how the MDGs have helped advocacy of particular development agendas. For popular agendas, such as those to reduce poverty (MDG 1) and infectious diseases (MDG 6), MDGs provided additional leverage, whereas for relatively neglected agendas such as child survival (MDG 4) and gender (MDG 3), their eff ect was to reinvigorate these campaigns. In the case of gender, for example, the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995 had led to the establishment of gender (Continued from previous page)• Indicator 6.3: proportion of population aged 15-24 years with comprehensive correct knowledge of HIV/AIDS • Indicator 6.4: ratio of school attendance of orphans to school attendance of non-orphans aged 10-14 years • Target 6B: achieve, by 2010, universal access to treatment for HIV/AIDS for all those who need it • Indicator 6.5: proportion of population with advanced HIV infection with access to antiretroviral drugs • Target 6C: have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the incidence of malaria and other major diseases • Indicator 6.6: incidence and death rates associated with malaria • Indicator 6.7: proportion of children younger than 5 years sleeping under insecticide-treated bednets • Indicator 6.8: proportion of children younger than 5 years with fever who are treated with appropriate antimalarial drugs • Indicator 6.9: incidence, prevalence, and death rates associated with tuberculosis • Indicator 6.10: proportion of tuberculosis cases detected and cured under directly observed treatment short course mechanisms and approaches to mainstreaming of gender issues within several ministries. Their achievements were fragile, 26, 27 until the MDGs stimulated donors to include gender equity in aid packages. [28] [29] [30] The MDGs are generally thought to have improved the targeting and fl ow of aid and other investments, supported by the way in which donors have linked the MDGs to their strategies for aid provision 6 and by evidence of an increase in resource mobilisation. 21 According to OECD fi gures, between 2000, when the Millennium Declaration was adopted, and 2006, total development assistance for health has more than doubled from US$6·8 billion to $16·7 billion, most of it focused on infectious diseases (MDG 6). 31 Large increases in donors\\' fi nancial commitments to education, which can fairly transparently be linked to MDG 2, were recorded after 2000.However, the cases of health and education also show how diffi cult it is to establish a cause and eff ect relationship between the MDGs and an increase in aid. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw the conceptualisation and creation of several independent initiatives in health and education, including the International Finance Facility for Immunisation; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; Business Alliance Against Chronic Hunger; and the initiatives following the Education for All conferences in Jomtien (1990) and Dakar (2000) , whose objectives overlapped with those adopted subsequently in MDG 6 and MDG 2. The contribution of the MDGs, in these cases, might best be viewed as reinforcing, rather than driving, the targeting and mobilisation of resources.Finally, the MDGs have stimulated an improvement in monitoring development programmes through data collection and analysis: \"Once the MDGs gained currency, a cascade of statistical and analytical work got underway\". 23 Although we have noted that across the MDGs there are profound questions about the quality of the data obtained from such monitoring, few would disagree that it has been benefi cial to evaluation, and probably to investment.\\n\\nChallenges posed by the MDGs\\n\\nSet against these positive contributions are several shortcomings that emerge consistently across our analysis of individual MDGs. Characteristically, most of these weaknesses present themselves as the fl ip side of the MDGs\\' more positive elements. Thus, the parsimony of the MDGs, which has probably facilitated their acceptance and use, makes them at the same time limited in scope, whereas their quantitative targets and precise indicators, for all their value in providing measurable outcomes, often fail to capture some crucial elements of goal achievement. We have to accept that all goal setting involves such trade-off s.However, the value of focusing on shortcomings of the MDGs lies in our potential to improve them, or replace them with something better. Ineff ective MDGs pose two risks: they might not achieve their intended eff ect, and they could lead to negative eff ects by ignoring or impeding more eff ective development and poverty reduction. Our analysis identifi es challenges with the MDGs in four areas: conceptualisation, execution, ownership, and equity. Other studies have also identifi ed cross-cutting issues, 12,22 which we will discuss as appropriate.\\n\\nConceptualisation and execution\\n\\nWe consider fi rst how well the MDGs have been developed at diff erent levels-goal, target, and indicator-which has obvious consequences for how well they have been executed at each level. For instance, an indicator for which accurate data cannot be obtained is poorly conceived and prevents execution of the target. In table 1 we show some diffi culties relating to conceptualisation and execution, drawn from our individual analyses of the MDGs presented in the webappendix. This list is illustrative and not meant to be comprehensive. Problems with the conceptualisation and execution of the MDGs arise at the goal, target, and indicator levels. This feature is shared by diff erent MDGs, and some goals have problems at more than one level. Broadly speaking, problems associated with the level of goals seem to relate to their being too narrow and fragmented, leaving gaps in which other important development objectives are missing. Problems at the target level often relate to their being incomplete or partial relative to the ambition of the goal, imprecise, or without a process of delivery. These problems tend to amplify the vertical nature of some goals, widening the gaps between them and reducing connectedness. Between 2005 and 2008, MDGs 1, 3, and 5 added targets aimed specifi cally at fi lling such gaps. Problems with indicators tend to be associated with measurement, ownership, or leadership. New indicators added during the course of the MDGs are especially prone to these problems.\\n\\nProblems with goals\\n\\nAs we noted in part 1, the MDGs represent a subset of a broader development vision expressed in the Millennium Declaration. Goals were never developed for several key objectives of the Declaration, including peace, security and disarmament, and human rights. The elements taken into the MDGs were in fact the specifi c targets associated with only one objective of the Declaration, that of development and poverty eradication. Some of these goals, being themselves derived from specifi c targets, were very narrow in conception: education goals focused mainly on primary education, whereas health goals focused only on three aspects of health associated with maternal mortality, child mortality, and specifi c diseases. For goals that were more broadly defi ned, such as poverty reduction, gender, or environmental sustainability, the few targets assigned to them did not capture their breadth. The consequences of building goals around targets were two-fold. First, very substantial gaps existed in the coverage of goals, with targets failing to address important development needs for that sector. Second, because narrow goals and targets were so fragmented, the potential linkages and synergies that exist between diff erent sectors proved diffi cult to exploit.Gaps in goals could have contributed to underinvestment in areas that are key to realisation of the MDGs\\' overall development vision. For instance, considering that most of the world\\'s poor people are rural farmers, and that agricultural production and its distribution are key factors in reducing hunger, the absence of agricultural targets from MDG 1 is striking. Did this leave us unprepared for the food price crisis of 2007 and the need to make food security a global agenda? The focus of MDG 2 on primary education and enrolment has led in some countries to a so-called policy myopia, and a neglect of both learning level achievement and of secondary and post-secondary education, with important implications for economic growth. MDG 3\\'s very narrow scope failed to capture several intrinsic women\\'s rights issues such as freedom from violence and adult literacy, which are two areas of extreme inequality. In some cases, these gaps have been addressed by additional targets, but these late additions, relative to original targets, tend not to have leadership or easily measured indicators (table 1).Urban and Sumner 32 identify the lack of attention to tackling climate change (which receives little mention in MDG 7) as one of the fundamental criticisms of the MDG framework. Similar to the examples above, its limited emphasis in the MDGs could be indicative of political sensitivity or lack of eff ective advocacy, but it also draws attention to the extent to which development priorities change over time, and the challenges facing a fi xed set of development goals.Problems with targets delivering goals Problems with indicators delivering targets For example, by targeting largely primary education, MDG 2 underdevelops secondary and tertiary education, for which opportunities to create substantial improvements in incomes and in health are greatest. These educational levels also generate the skilled workers that are needed to promote and service the non-education MDGs-in health, agriculture, water and sanitation, and environmental sustainability-and teachers for the achievement of MDG 2.Similarly, the little focus on nutrition within the MDGs fails to exploit the synergy of increasing household food security, improving children\\'s capacity to participate in and benefi t from education, and increasing resilience to maternal and infant disease threats. Table 2 shows some of the links between education, health, poverty reduction, and gender goals, from which it will be clear that many are unrealised in the present MDG framework because of the narrowness of MDG targeting.The interactions between education, poverty reduction, health, and gender are complex. Primary education provides access to higher levels of education, which raises earnings, 37, 38 while higher levels of female education lead to improvements in child health care. 39 These fi ndings indicate clear gains in poverty reduction through investments in education. But education\\'s relations with poverty, health, and gender are reciprocal. Children from poorer households enrol in fewer years of education, and in many systems poor girls enrol in fewer years than do poor boys. 9 Better child health and nutrition improve educational outcomes. 40, 41 These gender interactions are typical of those across the MDGs. Jones and colleagues 42 have shown how the failure to disaggregate data for men and women for poverty and sustainable development masks the gender dynamics of poverty, making the point that all stakeholders should \"champion the importance of gender equality as a cross-cutting issue that needs to be considered in all pro-poor policy and programming, including those aimed at MDG achievement\".In the present MDG process, some positive interaction will inevitably arise from the independent pursuit of diff erent MDG goals and targets, but even this interaction will need local interventions in poverty reduction, health, education, and gender equality coming together for the same groups of people. This convergence is made less likely by the reality that goals are compartmentalised into responsibilities of diff erent line ministries nationally, subnationally, and locally, which means that the potential for simultaneous actions in the same location, working with the same communities and households, is unlikely.Problems with targets delivering goals Problems with indicators delivering targets (Continued from previous page) \\n\\nFragmentation and lack of synergy\\n\\nThe gaps created by the fragmentation of goals and targets not only emphasise the omission of important development needs, but also fail to realise effi ciencies and even synergies arising from the potential links between goals. The narrow focus of the three health goals, MDGs 4, 5, and 6, tends to encourage vertical organisation of planning, fi nancing, procurement, delivery, monitoring, and reporting without suffi cient linkage or integration with the broader health system. 33 A lack of integration and effi ciency can be seen internationally, with UN agencies or departments competing for attention and funding (some of which predated the creation of the MDGs); nationally with diff erent rewards and incentives for staff in diff erent programmes; and at the level of service delivery, for which particular programmes might have more generous space, equipment, or staffi ng levels than others, although the extent of this problem varies substantially across settings. Few of the technical interventions needed to achieve these three MDGs are logically or most costeff ectively delivered on their own. 34 Most health-service delivery is multipurpose and depends on horizontal systems, including the physical infrastructure, personnel, procurement and governance policies, and audit and monitoring systems.We are not saying that health systems do not need specifi c specialised services to address particular diseases such as HIV/AIDS, but that such services, although necessary, are not suffi cient to ensure sustainable health improvement into the future, with the exception of health improvement related to the very few diseases that can be eradicated, such as smallpox. Although investment in vertical health programmes could bring resources, such as new health centres, that benefi t health systems overall, their focus on particular diseases means that other national needs might be unsupported. For example, a study in Mali found that a campaign to treat neglected tropical diseases disrupted basic health services at health centres because of staff absences; and in 14 of 16 health centres staff were overburdened by the additional requirements of the campaign. 35 Similarly, vertical programmes bring investment in accounting and procurement services that could strengthen national health systems generally, but which could in practice be limited to servicing specifi c disease programmes, running in parallel to weak national systems. In countries where human resources are scarce, such as most low-income countries, staff move to where salaries, incentives, and working conditions are best. Thus although allocation for disease-specifi c funding might increase human resources in health systems, human resources might be drawn into specifi c programmes, neglecting other parts of the health system.Eff ective health systems need both vertical and horizontal components, and the MDGs have focused investment on the former, with the result that global health initiatives (GHIs) established with mandates to address specifi c diseases (such as The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; or the US President\\'s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief [PEPFAR]) or tightly focused objectives (such as the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation) have had a variable eff ect on improving national health systems. 36 Several of these GHIs are now working to broaden their remit to address the horizontal aspects of health-system strengthening more directly.The narrowness of MDG goals and targets also does not realise effi ciencies and synergies between sectors.\\n\\nTable 1: Goals and targets for MDGs 1-7, with observations on diffi culties with conceptualisation and execution\\n\\nHowever, precedents for such synergy can arise from targeted interventions in the same communities. For example, the Mid-day Meal programme reaches 120 million primary school children every school day in India and provides a cooked meal. The introduction of this nutrition programme has greatly raised school attendance 43 and, in conjunction with agricultural services, can stimulate farm input and output markets and agricultural development. Environmental sustainability should be a cross-cutting goal with potentials for synergy across sectors. However, MDG 7 targets 7A and 7B are not expressed in a way that links them to human welfare and development, making such linkage diffi cult. This shortcoming could be addressed with the concept of ecosystem services, whose development in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment paralleled the implementation of the MDGs. The role of ecosystems services is refl ected in the need for sustainable provision of water, soil, and biodiversity services to support agriculture and achievement of MDG 1 targets, and the importance of environmental factors to improved health. For example, 24% of the global disease burden is estimated to be associated with environmental factors, and 25% of all deaths in developing countries are linked to environmental risks. 44 The fragmentation of the MDGs has probably resulted in several lost opportunities to improve development outcomes. At its heart, of course, is the longstanding fragmentation of most human knowledge and activity into so-called sectoral \"silos\"-such as health, education, environment, etc-and even into separate silos within sectors, as seen clearly with health targets spread across MDGs 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. At the intergovernmental and intragovernmental level, this isolation is reinforced by a long tradition of institutional ownership and disciplinary identities that are embedded in professional qualifi cation systems, societies, and journals. By simply gathering together established goals and targets of these diff erent development communities, the MDGs could not hope to achieve the desired integrated approach that is appropriate to complex problems in international development. Worse, by fostering traditional and institutional ownership of diff erent MDG goals, the MDGs reinforced their isolation.\\n\\nProblems with targets and their indicators\\n\\nWe now consider the extent to which MDG targets and indicators have been designed to deliver its goals eff ectively. The use of a results-based framework is regarded as one of the strengths of the MDGs, and has certainly appealed in an aid context with the desire of donors to see measurable returns on investment. A focus on measurable MDG results does, however, mean that indicators are selected that capture neither the complexity of the target, because of the need for parsimony, nor the qualitative nature of much development progress. As indicated in the review of individual MDGs (webappendix) and table 1, this problem is common to many MDGs. MDG 2 provides a particularly clear example of how specifi c targets can be met without achieving their full intent. For this goal, the measurable target identifi ed for achievement of universal primary education is to ensure that, by 2015, all boys and girls are able to complete a full course of primary schooling. This target is accompanied by three indicators, of which only the fi rst, the net enrolment ratio, has been consistently measured, because the others are more diffi cult to assess. Hence progress on MDG 2 has been represented by changes in this ratio. However, this measure entails a very narrow view of primary education. In some contexts, enrolment in education, even in the last grade of primary, can mean\\n\\nEff ect on education Eff ect on health Eff ect on poverty and hunger reduction\\n\\nEff ect on gender equality Improvement in education .. Encourages good health practices, delays marriage, reduces fertility and child mortality, and improves maternal health; primary education provides access to secondary and post-secondary education and skilled health workers Improves agricultural productivity and off -farm employment opportunities; primary education provides access to secondary and post-secondary education and generates a skilled workforce Once targets are seen to be achieved, attention may be directed elsewhere. If target achievement falls short of goal achievement, then it is possible that further progress will not be made against that goal. In panel 3, we show this risk with an example of MDG 3 from South Africa.In conclusion, targets and their indicators frequently fall short of being meaningful measures of MDG achievement-for instance in MDG 2 with the net enrolment ratio as a proxy for education, in MDG 1 with income as a proxy for poverty reduction, and in MDG 3 with gender equity in schools as a proxy for societal change in gender equity. This criticism might seem rather severe-specifi c targets and indicators were never meant to measure all progress against a complex goal. Rather, they were meant to be indicative of progress. The risk, however, is that once targets and indicators become established, their indicative function is forgotten, and they become the end, not the means, of the MDGs. Such goal displacement, in which targets and indicators become more important than achievement of goals, is a common feature in management.A feature of MDG targets that has often been seen as a virtue is their caution not to prescribe how a target or its indicators should be achieved, although some are a partial means to a goal. This approach has mostly worked, insofar as a target for disease reduction or education, for example, is adopted by a particular development community which will identify or already have in place strategies for achieving it, as was the case for MDG 2. Nevertheless, this ownership of targets also fosters territorial attitudes.However, too little detail has proven to be a problem for other MDGs. MDG 1, for example, with its goal of halving poverty and hunger, does not have any indicators concerned with service access or with policy interventions. As with other goals, it has results-based outcome targets, relating to proportions of people above income thresholds, in employment, and underweight at a particular age, but no targets for mechanisms contributing to these outcomes-ie, it has no output targets. MDG 7 has a similar problem in that it has targets that encourage policies which reduce the loss of biodiversity and other natural resources, as outcomes, but it has no output targets in terms of policy interventions. Targets with these problems have less chance of eff ective execution than do others, since they are based only on observation of outcomes.The results-based nature of the MDG framework means that availability of good quality data is necessary to the use of specifi c indicators that monitor progress towards targets and goals. But national information systems are still weak in many countries, and data, if available, are likely to be of poor quality. This problem is compounded by technical diffi culties for some of the MDGs\\' indicators that might not be easy to measure yearly. For example, the number of children eligible to be enrolled in school forms the denominator of net and gross enrolment ratios. These ratios should be calculated every year, but population estimates are typically taken in a census once a decade.Our cross-MDG comparison suggests that, for most MDGs, only a few of several indicators are regularly measured and others fall away as yearly reporting progresses. The reasons are usually associated with the issues discussed in this section surrounding diffi culty of measurement, but leadership is also an issue. Where commitment to national or international measurement is limited, then indicators are rarely measured. Lack of measurement is a particular problem with more recently added targets, for instance in MDGs 1, 3, and 5, perhaps for reasons that they are either more complex or less broadly owned than others.Finally, criticism of the use of targets and indicators has to be tempered by the positive eff ect of the MDG process in stimulation of a culture of assessment, leading to investment in data collection and in monitoring and assessment in many countries, as well as regionally and subnationally. The MDGs have also inspired valuable research in the area of development eff ectiveness, which will benefi t future goal setting.\\n\\nOwnership\\n\\nThe MDG framework seemed to represent an important political consensus; that 189 countries signed up to one development plan was of huge symbolic signifi cance. It also off ered the potential to ensure national ownership Guy Collender, LIDC around global commitments. However, despite the widespread support for the MDGs internationally, to ensure ownership of the MDG process-including development and implementation-at diff erent levels and by diff erent stakeholders has been problematic.Multilateral and bilateral agencies were heavily involved in the early development of the MDG framework as it emerged from OECD DAC and UN processes. Although they were brought in at the later stages of the process, and were signatories to the MDG framework, thus agreeing to work towards their implementation, the involvement of developing countries in the initial development of the framework was small. As a result, meaningful national ownership by developing countries has been mixed and often weak. We will consider ownership of the MDGs at three levels-by the international development community, by civil society, and by national programmes in developing countries-and the problems associated with each.The principle of ownership arises from our analysis in part 2 (and particularly the lack of MDG ownership that might exist nationally), from our conceptualisation of wellbeing as including participation and voice, and from our consideration of the requirements for sustainability. Much of the discussion of ideas of global social justice focuses on the problems of attending to diff erent local, national, regional, and global communities, and the politics of articulating and negotiating very diff erent interests, 109, 110 and our method for elaboration of this conception of development has taken as a starting point the acceptance of a plurality of societies in the world.We have seen in our examples from diff erent countries that MDGs have usually been incorporated into national development programmes where they fi t local priorities. Alternatively, MDGs could stimulate a change in national priorities if donor funding for MDGs causes governments to change their strategies to take advantage of opportunities for external investment. These observations suggest a need for greater ownership of the process of goal development both nationally and internationally. Questions about who sets goals, how they are represented and legitimated, and what relationships they have with targets must be of central concern. National and local ownership and a new framework for international partnerships will be crucial for what comes next, both in terms of refl ection on the nature of global obligation and the establishment of particular goals and targets.We propose that the search for developmental goals after 2015 should begin from a comprehensive conceptualisation of development and the core development principles proposed to govern both the specifi cations of development goals and the processes by which they are specifi ed. This process should be undertaken, and its product owned, by all countries by use of forms of open discussion and public scrutiny, as suggested by Sen, 95 and we emphasise therefore that our set of principles and elements of wellbeing are only examples of what these principles and elements might look like.However, these goals might subsequently have to be narrowed or otherwise amended to achieve comprehensive commitment to the development agenda. Goal setting at this level should focus on the planning of national and local programmes by national constituencies. National priorities will diff er, but all agreed elements of wellbeing should be considered, such that diff erences refl ect local priorities. Priorities would need to be developed through an equitable process of discussion and deliberation with some agreed processes of how consensus was to be reached with regard to national priorities. Operationally, a process that is given suffi cient time to include civil society participation (and appropriate accountability processes) would be needed. A focus on local priorities would be important to ensure that targets set are locally relevant, not only national aggregates, and that they do not aim too low.National target setting would need an element of regional and global input, especially to address environmental development needs that are supranational, such as climate change adaptation and mitigation, and to address international issues such as the eff ect of trade or migration of skilled workers on human and social elements of wellbeing. A process to integrate local, national, and regional priorities to generate national, regional, and global targets will thus be needed, with mechanisms to reach consensus. Although brokering and negotiation between powerful players is one way to achieve this process, a better approach might be to adopt mechanisms that allow subsidiarity, opt outs, or variations in specifi cation of targets between global, regional, national, and subnational jurisdictions-although of course these are not without their challenges.Equally important for ownership is a mechanism to review progress towards targets that ensures national dialogue (involving governments and civil society) around the targets and the data associated with them. This mechanism could entail: independent national bodies established and tasked with monitoring progress with wide participation of a range of groups; national collection and review of data; external comparative analysis in partnership with multilateral bodies or international organisations; and national analysis and decision on action in the form of public, parliamentary, press, or other forms of debate and discussion. The changing international architecture of the UN would be an important backdrop to this process, with action to avoid the present fragmentation of development goals between diff erent UN bodies, through strong central leadership. UN agencies could assist with the circulation of information, convening of meetings 26 for crucial refl ection across countries, and identifi cation of where particular resources for initiatives might be located. But the dynamism associated with other cross-national organisations of civil society would also be an important resource.\\n\\nOwnership by the international community\\n\\nImplementation diffi culties for some MDGs are indicative of the institutional structure around the MDGs and, in some cases, lack of or confusion around ownership between diff erent UN and multilateral agencies. For instance, the absence of ownership of MDG 3 inter nationally has made it particularly diffi cult to implement. Reactions have been mixed nationally, although the decision of the Commission on the Status of Women in 2009 sought to link together the Beijing Platform of Action and advancement of MDG 3 through the work of the UN Division for the Advancement of Women. 55 Territorial issues with leadership have also aff ected implementation. This eff ect is most noticeable with health, for which the various health MDGs, by design, were mapped onto the institutional structure of health interests. The HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria professional groups, NGOs, and research community\\'s link to MDG 6; the maternal health community to MDG 5; and the child health community (with another strong professional group, the paediatricians) to MDG 4. A further, important, interest group that strengthens the position of MDG 6 relative to the others is that of the pharmaceutical industry, which has clear fi nancial interests in funding streams that are associated with the purchase of relatively costly drugs and commodities such as antiretroviral drugs, and received particular mention in MDG 8.In principle, institutional ownership should improve leadership, but this eff ect might not arise when ownership is too fragmented or when it is contested. For example, within the UN agencies, the ownership of maternal health is split, causing a scarcity of leadership for MDG 5. Within WHO, the lead technical agency, maternal health is split between Making Pregnancy Safer, the Human Reproduction Programme, and (for newborn babies) the Department for Child and Adolescent Health. Among agencies with funds for implementation, both UNICEF and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) have a role, which can be crudely defi ned as UNICEF being concerned with antenatal and postnatal care, and UNFPA with delivery care. In practice, activity depends on strengths in country. UNICEF adopts a community focus, and UNFPA staff traditionally have reproductive rather than maternal health expertise. The World Bank has played less of a lead in recent years, and a global fund does not specifi cally address maternal health. An attempt to pull together groups within the Partnership for Maternal Newborn and Child Health has been only partly successful so far, and did not always receive full backing by the UN agencies themselves.\\n\\nPanel 2: diffi culties with targets for MDG 2 in India\\n\\nThe target for MDG 2 aims to have all children completing a full course of primary schooling. For India, estimates suggest that close to 95% of children aged 6-14 years are enrolled in school. 45 The Indian Government has a policy of automatic promotion from one grade to the next each year, which implies that it is not diffi cult for enrolled children to move from grade 1 to grade 5.But is enrolment a good measure for understanding who is in school regularly? Several studies have shown that despite very high enrolment, regular attendance in school is an issue of major concern in some states. Government data from 2006 show that in 11 of the 20 major states, average attendance in primary school was less than 80%. 46 When measured very carefully, fi ndings from the SchoolTELLS study showed that for the school year 2007-08, in the schools sampled for the study, only 25% of enrolled children in Bihar and 44% in Uttar Pradesh attended school regularly. 47 The visit of researchers from Assessment Survey Evaluation Research (ASER) in 2009 to a school on a random day indicated that attendance was lower than 80% in ten of 20 major states, with numbers below 60% being recorded in populous and educationally underperforming states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. 45 In poor regions, despite incentives such as free school meals, uniforms, scholarships, and textbooks, children are not regularly in school. Stable and regular attendance patterns are an essential condition for eff ective teaching and learning. Closer tracking of attendance needs to be a high priority for state governments in India.No national longitudinal study has been done in India that follows successive cohorts of children from the fi rst year until the last year of primary school or beyond, so the primary school completion target is diffi cult to measure accurately. With the assumption that a large majority of children actually do complete primary schooling, assessment of what benefi ts the achievement of this target would represent is crucial, given that the MDG goal does not include a universal learning target. For the past 5 years the ASER survey has been measuring basic reading levels across India. ASER 2009 reports that only 52·8% of rural children in India in standard fi ve can fl uently read text at standard two level. 45 The situation for mathematics is even more dismal. Less than 40% of children in standard fi ve can do a numerical division problem (three digit by one digit division) correctly. Most states in India expect children to reach this level by the end of standard three or four. Therefore by the time that an average rural Indian child completes the primary stage she or he is at least 2-3 years academically behind where she or he is expected to be. At least half of all children in India are leaving primary school not being able to read fl uently or do basic arithmetic operations. Where does this evidence point us? What needs to be done to ensure a meaningful completion of primary school? Criteria for measurement of progress towards the completion goal have to include methods and mechanisms to assess children\\'s and teachers\\' attendance in schools regularly. Next, clear learning goals need to be articulated. It is against these benchmarks of enrolment, attendance, survival, and learning that the MDG 2 goal of completion needs to be measured.UNICEF and WHO have also had a complex relationship over involvement in, and ownership of, MDG 4. By the time that they became involved, other organisations had taken the lead in a fi eld that was traditionally theirs. Discord between WHO and UNICEF seems to have worsened during the 1990s, with WHO taking a lead role in the development and implementation of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI), while UNICEF moved into the technical leadership role that was traditionally occupied by WHO.The MDG process has largely been seen as donor driven, and issues of concern to civil society have been neglected from the agenda. This view is evident in MDG 2 with the narrowing of the Education For All agenda to the MDG agenda of Universal Primary Education, and in MDG 3 for which issues of concern to the global women\\'s movement, including violence against women, reproductive rights, and adult literacy, were not included in the targets. In this case, there was a struggle between gender and women\\'s right activists as to whether to ignore the MDGs altogether and continue mobilisation around the Beijing Platform or whether to engage tactically with the MDG process and try to secure commitment that MDG 3 would not be overlooked. 56 The mismatch between civil society agendas and those in the highly selected MDGs has implications for the ways in which civil society mobilises around the MDGs, and plays a part nationally in holding governments to account on their commitments. When particular MDGs do not include issues of concern to civil society they are unlikely to be a main focus of their advocacy eff orts, nationally or globally.The MDG discourse seems to have been used most successfully by the international community to drive for funds. Advocacy has been benefi cial and eff ective when what is wanted nationally coincides with international advocacy eff orts. This has been particularly the case in health, with the renaissance of child survival prompted by MDG 4, and with the supportive role of MDG 6 in mobilising funding for reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS.The domination of wealthy countries and their development communities in the MDG process also generates a problem of representation and asymmetry in the process of development of the MDG targets, whereby those with the money chose the targets. Although targets for poor countries are emphasised, the MDGs that by their nature involved wealthy and poor countries, MDG 7 and MDG 8, fell short of setting specifi c targets. Poverty rather than inequity is regarded as the challenge, thereby relieving wealthy countries of having targets of their own.\\n\\nNational ownership\\n\\nIn 2003, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) pronounced \"Governments, aid agencies and civil society organizations everywhere are re-orienting their work around the Goals\". 1 Indeed, many low-income countries have made an eff ort to link their own national development strategies to the MDGs, which can provide impetus for the achievement of both. Panel 4 shows how the Government of Malawi has made use of the MDGs. Other national plans that were able to be incorporated into the MDGs included Vision 2025 in Tanzania and Vision 2020 in Rwanda. 22 However, in view of the importance that donors put on the MDGs, governments might feel pressure to show progress against their specifi c targets, whatever their national priorities might be. The MDGs are frequently mentioned by ministries in the poorest countries, and are often referred to in poverty reduction strategy papers. 22, 25 Fukuda-Parr\\'s analysis of 22 such papers has shown how almost all of them mentioned the MDGs, but the focus in most countries was selective. 22 Developing countries could be merely seeking to satisfy donor expectations in their reference to MDGs in poverty reduction strategy papers, and local documents might amount to \"little more than political correctness\". 3 China presents a particularly clear case of the discrepancy between how donors and developing countries regard the MDGs. The UK Department for International Development\\'s priorities regarding China are couched in MDG discourse, particularly MDGs 2, 6, and 7, yet there is an explicit recognition that the Chinese Government does not approach the country\\'s development in the same way. 59 China does not have an overarching document such as a poverty reduction strategy paper that describes how it aims to reduce poverty and achieve the MDGs. Many of the same sectors covered in the MDGs appear in China\\'s 5-year plan for 2006-11, yet the targets diff er. For example, ambitions include average education for citizens to be increased to 9 years, and 100 million rural residents to be provided with access to safe drinking water. 60 The MDGs are an irrelevance to China\\'s own development strategy. InThe printed journal includes an image merely for illustration some cases the infl exible nature of the MDG framework, and the focus on targets rather than broader goals, has contributed to countries distancing themselves from a global agenda that is seen as irrelevant to their particular developmental situation.For low-income countries, however, the donor resources associated with the MDGs can be attractive to governments that are struggling to meet their own strategic targets. For example, the provision of antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS-an element of MDG 6-has been favoured by donors such as PEPFAR, but not always as a priority in country-led health strategies. Panel 5 shows how the national health strategy of Zambia has shifted to improve incorporation of this and other MDG targets. Although this approach could be seen as donor-driven distortion of national strategy, it also is indicative of a pragmatic national desire to develop benefi cial health strategies that have a high chance of successful implementation.If particular issues are not already regarded as priorities for governments, they might simply not be taken up, other than to fulfi l obligations for reporting of, or responding to, donor priorities. This has been a particular problem with MDGs 3 and 5 because of the low status of women. Finally, the mismatch of global goals with national circumstances or priorities could create perverse incentives that misdirect time and resources. Countries that are faced with a range of locally challenging or inappropriate targets might be inclined to focus on those actions that will contribute most to their overall MDG progress results. These actions might be directed towards population groups who are quick to respond, raising issues of equity that we will explore in the next section.A particular problem with MDG ownership is the extent to which global goals have been inappropriately interpreted as national ones. Each MDG, apart from MDG 8, has a global target to be achieved by 2015, usually set as a relative level of progress from the level in 1990 based on historical global trends. These global targets are also set without adjustment as country-level targets. They were never intended as national targets, but they have been consistently applied in this manner, ignoring local context and the intercountry diff erence in technical feasibility and fi nancial aff ordability. The application of global goals to poor African countries which were never expected individually to meet them generates defeatism and negativity locally, and \"Afropessimism\" on an international scale. 24 The linear extrapolations on which several MDG targets are based might possibly fi t the averaging that is inherent in setting global goals, but they could be entirely inappropriate as a measure of national progress. For example, the capacity to reduce child mortality rates in any country is more likely to be S-shaped than linear. 69 Initial eff orts in the presence of high mortality rates need much eff ort for modest improvements. Then as services in health systems are established, there is a phase during which substantial improvements are possible with rather less input. Finally, there is a phase in which much greater eff ort and resources are needed to make further improvements. The assumption that a similar eff ort in any country will produce a similar reduction in child mortality was naive, since experience with child mortality reduction shows that for most African countries to achieve MDG 4 will be almost impossible.\\n\\nPanel 3: Achievement of MDG 3 in South Africa\\n\\nInternationally, the MDGs act as a powerful public relations exercise. While governments have their own national goals and targets developed and responsive to a national political dynamic, pressure to meet the international development goals is particularly strong because it exposes government performance in a global arena. This pressure has the advantage of holding national political leaders to account against clearly quantifi able targets, but can also lead to governments manipulating statistics or to complacency by which targets seem to be met.One problem with ticking off the indicator for a target as a success is that it may blunt initiatives to fulfi l wider dimensions of the goal. A focus on quantity might aim to include as many people as possible in the benefi ts associated with a particular target. However, losing qualitative dimensions means that important aspects of realising the full dimensions of the goal are lost.Some aspects of this eff ect are illustrated in a study of South Africa\\'s response to MDG 3. The indicators associated with the target for MDG 3-to eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education-have been met. 9, 48 South Africa has achieved gender parity in primary net enrolment ratio, the proportion of boys and girls who complete 5 years of primary schooling, and in literacy rates in young adults. More young women are in secondary and tertiary education than are young men. But these achievements against the indicators provide only a small insight into the broader goal.Interviews undertaken with offi cials in the national Department of Education and a provincial Ministry in 2008 and 2009 as part of the Gender, Education and Global Poverty Reduction Initiatives research project indicated that South Africa was proud of having met the quantitative targets for gender parity, but that for several offi cials this was suffi cient achievement on gender issues, and that other areas should get more priority. 49 Schools are assumed to promote equity simply by having achieved parity, and so their complicity in perpetuating inequitable gender relations often goes unacknowledged. As a result, data from the Gender, Education and Global Poverty Reduction Initiatives project indicate that teachers and government offi cials locate the source of gender problems in the family, both in terms of blame and responsibility for fi nding solutions.However, several studies document how, despite policy declarations which stress the importance of gender and race equality, South African schools are sites of gender discrimination. 50 This discrimination is manifest in school regimes that do not question, but in fact reproduce, norms associated with male achievement and female subordination. The diffi culties for teachers in using the curriculum to question and change these assumptions are compounded by employment practices, which often make it diffi cult for women, who make up a large part of the teaching profession, to gain promotion. 51 Although the HIV epidemic off ered many opportunities for schools to engage in refl ection on questions of sex and gender, and some creative engagements emerged, it was often very diffi cult to challenge deeply-held assumptions. Many studies identify practices of gender-based violence in schools or associated with teachers and the policy challenges that these entail. [52] [53] [54] Clearly education policy concerned with promotion of greater equality needs to recognise the ways in which schooling encourages inequitable gendered relations and the ways in which policies and practices might themselves constitute gender relationships. Working with the MDG framework means that a country can have fulfi lled the target, but this does not always achieve the spirit of the goal.\\n\\nEquity\\n\\nThe issue of equity arose in the analysis of most MDG sectors. It is a central issue that has its roots in the initial formulation of the MDGs as poverty reduction and development goals targeted at poor countries, rather than global goals created for all countries. Issues of inequity within the MDG framework are not obvious, but they could be the most serious shortcoming of the MDGs because they associate the MDGs with minimally ameliorating major areas of need for a proportion of the population, rather than diminishing the major gaps between wealthy and poor people, both within and between countries, in ways that benefi t everyone.In this context, inequity means inequality that is unfair. Fraser 70 developed an expansive notion of gender equity that goes considerably beyond equality. She associates equity with practices that confer dignity for all, and that are against poverty, exploitation, marginalisation, and misogyny. Additionally, these practices entail fairness in relation to income and leisure time. This defi nition alerts us to inequity as a process that entails not simply assessing amounts of a particular health, income, or education goods, but also paying careful attention to the relationships associated with distribution. The MDGs enable us to focus on access to minimum levels of provision in health, education, or earnings, but they do not go far enough to address unfair social relations associated with crossing a line of minimum adequacy.Part of the diffi culty in making targets go far enough is the way in which inequity is measured. Inequity is usually described in economic terms, most frequently as wealth quintiles, based on possessions owned by the household. 71 This is a convenient approach that can be applied to information such as the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data to analyse income or consumption. In many settings, wealth quintiles eff ectively indicate other inequities within a society. They draw attention to diff erences in key markers of access and outcome between those who do and do not have material assets, which provide a mechanism to examine diff erences between countries in terms of how these assets are distributed. Some specifi c measures of inequalities in wealth have been developed, such as the Gini coeffi cient which measures the extent to which distribution of wealth is uneven. Other measures are the ratio of the incomes of the richest 10% or 20% of the population compared with the poorest 10% or 20%. 72 The use of wealth quintiles as a means to measure equity has featured explicitly in only one MDG target, MDG 1 target 1A, for which indicators include measurement of a poverty gap ratio (between lowest and highest wealth quintiles) and the share of the poorest quintile in national consumption. However, wealth quintiles have been used extensively in analyses of healthrelated MDGs undertaken by the World Bank, UNICEF, and others, 73,74 and very recently in work into the distribution of education enrolment rates. 9 But wealth, income, or consumption are not the only features of inequity. Factors such as geography and ethnic origin might be more important in identifi cation of inequities, both in access and outcome of health interventions. 75 In rural Papua New Guinea and Ethiopia, the most important determinant of access to health care, and health outcomes, may be geography. Asset indices do not always predict health outcomes. In some settings, geography, ethnic origin, or other factors might be more dominant factors. But the absence of measures that capture these other factors across diff erent societies means that these features of inequity in distribution are overlooked.Importantly, asset indices cannot inform us about the gender dynamics of wealth distribution within a household or a community. 76 Many household studies in developing countries show how little access women have to household resources. 77 This defi cit comes into sharp focus when the household is faced with an emergency, particularly a health emergency. The outcome of such an emergency, especially when children are involved, is strongly aff ected by the extent of women\\'s empowerment within a community. 76 Several studies in high-income countries show that inequality is often associated with other social ills. Wilkinson and Pickett 78 associate inequality in income with a range of aspects of ill health, such as low life expectancy, mental health problems, and obesity, and markers of social dislocation such as violence and imprisonment. They argue that societies with large gaps between rich and poor people have adverse consequences for everyone, including those who earn well. Their work and many other large-scale review studies on equalities 79 suggest that inequity means much more than inequality in income levels.The notion of equity has a universal assumption in that it benefi ts all people, not just the disadvantaged sections of society. Preservation of inequity or lack of distribution for some, while addressing suffi ciency or better for others, is not the way to maximise benefi ts for a society. Many of the targets associated with the MDGs focus on improving conditions for some, but not addressing wellbeing for all. This inequity is the case for all targets that focus on changing the proportion of people experiencing a particular hardship-eg, reducing the maternal mortality ratio or the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day. Even when these MDG targets are achieved, a proportion of the population would remain below a line of adequacy and the inequities within a society would not be resolved. Reduction of the number of people living on $1 a day or less will relieve some people from extreme poverty, but only just. If action is directed only at those near the threshold, the eff ect might be to increase inequity, pulling those accessible populations across the poverty line, thereby widening the gap between them and those still below the threshold. The fundamental inequities in income distribution will remain and will continue to erode the foundation of society.The MDG approach has led to a social policy that has focused on the easiest way to bring particular groups just above a poverty line relating to income levels, school enrolment, etc. This approach has been benefi cial for some populations, but still leaves problems of marginalisation, poverty, inequality, and little dignity for many people whose specifi c circumstances often disappear in aggregated reporting on MDG achievement. For example, in India in 2005, children achieved an average 7·5 years in school, nearly completing a cycle of primary and elementary education. Children from the richest quintile, both boys and girls, completed on average 11 years of schooling, whereas boys from the poorest quintile completed 5 years of schooling, and girls completed only 3 years. 9 Thus, although India was on track to meet the MDG 2 target, inequities in educational opportunities were being perpetuated between diff erent population groups, and between the sexes. For MDG 7, improvements in access to improved sanitation are substantial, but are also strongly associated with the wealthiest quintiles of the population. 4 Health interventions associated with MDGs 4, 5, and 6 are mainly applied through established health services, tending to favour the same individuals who have been covered by previous interventions. They might live near the road or the health post, have relatives who have been trained as health workers, or have access to information. Those who are both geographically and socially far away from the rest of the population do not receive the intervention. A district level study 80 of child mortality in Tanzania since 1988 draws attention to the fact that in a poor African country that has made admirable progress towards child survival, there is substantial variability in the progress made, and the districts that were doing well in 1988 improved at a greater rate than did the poorer districts. Thus the improved child survival that Tanzania has recorded has been at the expense of worsening geographical inequity. 80 In education, many countries have expanded access to primary education through abolishment of school fees (eg, Mozambique, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya); however, this intervention has not always meant that all costs associated with schooling are lifted from poor parents or that high-quality education is delivered. Indeed, in many countries the poorest children have the least qualifi ed and supported teachers. Often the language of instruction at school used by teachers is not the same as that which children speak at home. Families struggle to meet the hidden costs of schooling-eg, costs associated with clothing, transport, or additional tuition. 9 Free education is not necessarily associated with improved equity since other factors, such as attitudes of blame,The analysis in part 2 drew attention to inequity as a major problem arising from the formulation of some MDG goals, targets, and indicators. To go beyond these shortcomings, we see equity and fairness as a key principle for future development goal setting. Equity expresses some of the values associated with justice which we see as intrinsic to the notion of development that we have elaborated. Sen has argued that aspects of equality, whether these are related to rights to hold property, vote, or earn the same level of income, are a core component of ideas about justice in the contemporary world. 105 Although diff erences might exist with regard to what type of equality is valued or emphasised, equality in some space is a central aspiration, and the notion of equity distils the types of social relations entailed in ensuring this aim. Drawing on changing meanings of the word equity in English from the 14th century, Unterhalter 106 has identifi ed three diff erent levels of equity comprising equity from above, which needs a fair system of institutional arrangements; equity from below, which entails processes of participation and discussion; and equity from the middle, which ensures the effi cient fl ow of services, information, and investment. All three are necessary and complement each other, emphasising aspects of holism discussed in the previous section.Equity is often discussed in terms of equity of opportunity or outcome. Ensuring equity of opportunity is often associated with putting in place the institutional arrangements for managed provision of health, education, or employment services. In an economy, these services and opportunities provide employment or provide credit for investment in producing goods to generate income. In education, they include providing appropriately sited schools, making universal opportunities for school attendance, and access to the curriculum through an appropriate language policy and training suffi cient teachers. In health, provision of these services means building suffi cient health facilities, training staff , and ensuring a supply of drugs. For the environment, it means providing access to clean water and air, and harvestable natural resources resulting from the Equity of outcome provides an alternative assessment of whether personal heterogeneities have been considered in relation to health, education, or poverty elimination. Processes that can help to secure this entail attention to participation in the evaluation of services, concern with aff ordability, and adaptability of services to meet diverse circumstances. A principle of equity in development goal settings needs, therefore, to address equity of both opportunity and outcome. Achievement of a level of wellbeing for all people will need the development of a more equitable world, built on more equitable societies in which there are adequate fl ows of information, understanding, resources, training, and respect to enable diverse individuals to attain a decent quality of life. The principle of equity applies across generations (including elderly, middle aged, and young people, children, and unborn babies, and thus incorporates sustainability) and within generations (eg, across nations, social groups, and gender).Equity requires a focus on the needs of each community or country, and the particular historical, geographic, linguistic, or gender dimensions of inequity. A simple approach to this requirement in goal setting is to build into survey instruments the variables needed to analyse the true determinants of inequity in health, learning, food security, and other outcomes. These variables will usually be seen as economic (wealth quintiles), geographic (distance from a functioning service-eg, health facility or school), ethnic (belonging to a deprived or discriminated ethnic group), age-related (children, young families, elderly people), or associated with gender (touching on distributional issues inside the family and capacity to participate in the labour market or decisionmaking bodies). Information has to be disaggregated so that inequity in one parameter is not obscured by another. Once the most appropriate variable, or variables, have been identifi ed for a specifi c country, they can be incorporated into access, process, and outcome indicators and can then be monitored, both as national averages, and as markers of trends to reduce inequities.To ensure equitable outcomes, assessing equity also entails establishing processes for improved participation in collective public discussions and decision making concerning not only aspects of learning and health provision, but also all areas that aff ect people\\'s wellbeing. These include global, national, and local economic policy and political issues at all levels, and are related to the principles of ownership and obligation.\\n\\nPanel 4: National implementation of MDGs in Malawi\\n\\nMalawi has been orienting its development activities towards the achievement of the MDGs. This shift is evident from the development strategies that have been formulated by the government, the articulation of the development strategy in the budget process, and the commitment to monitor progress on the indicators of the MDGs.The MDGs in Malawi are implemented through a medium-term development strategy known as the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy for 2006-11; its overall goal is to reduce poverty through sustainable economic growth and infrastructure development. The strategy focuses on six key priority areas: agriculture and food security; irrigation and water development; transport infrastructure development; energy generation and supply; integrated rural development; and prevention and management of nutrition disorders and HIV/AIDS. 57 There is a clear articulation about how the focus on these six priority areas is to contribute to the achievement of the MDGs. The budget framework is also fully aligned to the strategy, and by implication to the achievement of the MDGs, by being framed in such a way that it refl ects expenditure allocations to pro-poor sectors in Malawi.Since 2006, Malawi has been monitoring its progress towards the achievement of the MDGs and assessment of the possibility of achieving the targets by 2020. The Government of Malawi, through the Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation, publishes the Malawi MDGs report every year. The most recent 2008 Malawi MDGs report documents remarkable progress in many areas and projects that some of the goals are likely to be achieved by 2020. Progress has been registered in eradication of extreme poverty (MGD 1); reduction of child mortality (MGD 4); and combating of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases (MDG 6); while daunting challenges remain in improving maternal health, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equality, and empowerment of women. In terms of achieving the MDGs, the recent assessment shows that Malawi is likely to meet the 2020 target for MDGs 1, 4, 6, and 7, while MDGs 3 and 5 are unlikely to be met and MDG 2 is potentially feasible. 58The very substantial progress that has been made in MDG 1 in reduction of the proportion of the population in extreme poverty from 53·9% in 2000 to 45% in 2006 has been achieved because of several interventions-eg, the implementation of the agricultural input subsidy, introduction of social support programmes for vulnerable groups, pro-poor allocation of public expenditures, and macroeconomic management leading to positive economic growth rates in the past 5 years. These interventions have been assisted by good weather and high tobacco prices, and high political will to implement pro-poor programmes. The implementation of the agricultural input subsidy has enabled the country to produce more food, with the stunting and wasting of children younger than 5 years falling from 6·4% and 6·8%, respectively, in 2005, to 4·9% and 5·8% in 2007. Poverty reduction and food security have been at the centre of the political and development agenda of the country, and MDG 1 has added impetus to the implementation of programmes aimed at reducing poverty in the country.distancing, or marginalisation, maintain existing inequities. 81 Although some countries have worked to improve the provision of education to the poorest groups through a focus on improved teacher quality, better learning materials, and social assistance, realisation of this policy remains a challenge, particularly in schools for the poorest children. [82] [83] [84] Thus the MDGs promote an approach that might systematically exclude individuals at highest risk, achieving improvements on indicators by focusing on those populations that are easiest to reach. This is not a new occurrence. Even before the appearance of the MDGs, for example, most countries that made substantial gains in child survival between the 1980s and the 1990s achieved these gains at the expense of increasing inequity, since successive interventions targeted and excluded the same groups of children as before. 85, 86 The approach underpinning the MDGs and their targets for poverty, education, gender, health, and the environment is the attainment of a specifi c minimum standard for a proportion of the world\\'s people. There are other possible approaches that would be more equitable. For example, the target might be fully adequate provision for all, taking account for particular heterogeneities, or it might be narrowing of the gap between the most privileged and the most deprived, ensuring that no group is below a level of adequacy. A deliberate, pro-poor or human rights approach can be taken, actively addressing inequities and realising rights for the poorest people. Some countries, such as Peru, have deliberately adopted a pro-poor approach to child-survival strategies. 87 Unfortunately, such countries are the exception.In conclusion, the present MDG framework does not address inequity by maintaining a concern with just adequate provision for some, ignoring the needs of those who are too hard to reach and not addressing the diffi culties of inequality in societies that seem to have deleterious consequences for everyone, not only the poorest people. More equitable MDG targets would not only help those near the threshold, but could direct improved, rather than minimal, resources at the poorest groups.\\n\\nPart 3: framing of future development goals Introduction\\n\\nThe MDGs have had a substantial eff ect, both with respect to focusing resources and eff orts on important development objectives, and also more generally in raising public and political interest in the development agenda, engaging for the fi rst time a wide range of sectors and disciplines in a concerted eff ort. As we approach the UN Summit on Sept 20-22, 2010, the two-thirds mark towards the target date for the MDGs, attention is focused on the achievement of existing goals. But there is also much interest in what happens after 2015. Many diff erent views have been expressed about that future. Sumner 88 has suggested three broad options: (1) continue with the same MDGs, with or without a timeline (Sachs has argued for 2025); 89 (2) create new targets, perhaps locally defi ned, with or without a timeline; or (3) combine the MDGs with something new (ie, an inner core of the existing MDGs, but add new and locally defi ned targets as an outer core).Manning has responded to what happens after 2015 by emphasising the need to move beyond confl ating development with aid and to recognise the eff ect of global factors and changing international power structures. 3 The Chronic Poverty Report of 2008-09 argues for a new development agenda to include access to basic social protection for all poor and vulnerable people by 2020, universal access to post-primary education by 2020, and leading to the elimination of absolute poverty by 2025. 90 In the fi nal section of this report, we apply our cross-MDG, cross-sectoral comparison to consider the future of development goals. Hence we focus on what might come after the MDGs, in view of the MDG experience. This is not to belittle in any way the importance of trying to achieve the existing MDGs in the next 5 years. Our premise is that, whether or not present MDGs are continued, modifi ed, or replaced after 2015, we should move forward having learned the lessons of the previous 15 years, and addressed any weaknesses that have become apparent in MDGs. In part 1, we examined individual MDGs and identifi ed their specifi c challenges, which we used in part 2 to draw out common challenges that cut across the goals. We found that the core challenges relate to reducing gaps and fragmentation in the MDGs, enhancing their integration, improving targeting and indicators, and ensuring equity and ownership. The reasons for fragmentation, incoherence, and gaps in the existing MDGs lie in their origins; although they included goals from a range of sectors, a common, cross-sectoral vision of development was not the basis for their formulation. Rather, as we have noted in part 1, the specifi c goals that emerged from the MDG formulation process were largely targets established in independent, earlier sectoral initiatives, grouped together and edited for political sensitivity, to maximise broad international support. Looking forward, we consider that any project after 2015 should be built on a coherent and shared approach to development, which can guide action across diff erent sectors including, but not confi ned to, addressing poverty, inequity, and environmental degradation, and improving gender equity, education, and health.\\n\\nDefi nition of development\\n\\nDevelopment is an ambiguous, multifaceted, and contested notion that in diff erent contexts and to diff erent people can describe aspirations, outcomes, or processes concerned with wider political, social, or economic change. Diff erent development approaches vary in their emphasis on these diff erent elements of developmenteg, on economic growth, modernisation, or structural change-and in their understandings of the natures of, and relations between, means and ends. Anand and Sen draw attention to helpful distinctions between ends (eg, wellbeing, freedom, and capabilities or expanded choices) and means (eg, wealth and economic growth), 91 in line, for example, with Habermas\\'s 92 diff erentiation between human forms of communication and solidarity on the one hand and highly rationalised demands for economic effi ciency on the other. They also emphasise the importance of considering universal intergenerational and intragenerational distribution together, to examine the potential for both complementary synergies (eg, in investments in maternal health and in education) and the competition for resources (eg, between present and future consumption) in discussions of sustainable development. Development invokes concerns with normative aspiration, process, and practice, which generally entail assessment.We have already considered how diff erent elements of the MDGs are compatible with, and indeed are derived from, diff erent conceptualisations of development. The MDGs are fragmented not only in their implementation but also in their underlying conceptualisations of development and overlapping of means and ends. Thus economic growth is considered in MDG 1 (or at least in the dominant concept that economic growth is the key driver of poverty reduction); MDGs 2-6 are more concerned with basic needs and human development (although MDG 3 focuses on a particular end regarding one aspect of equity); MDG 7 is concerned with both environmental sustainability and basic needs (of sanitation and urban dwellings); whereas MDG 8 mainly addresses structural issues in international trading and fi nancial systems and relations (although targets measure these in terms of Offi cial Development Assistance [ODA] fl ows, tariff s and subsidies aff ecting trade, and debt relief). While this approach captures a range of development perspectives, it generates a poorly aligned mixture of means, ends, and sometimes competing ideas about normative aspiration (eg, economic growth vs sustainability), which has made the MDG project less useful than it could have been, since opportunities to link the goals together coherently have been missed and a rigorous approach to assessment has been overlooked.Building on both our cross-sectoral analysis of the MDGs and other multidimensional understandings of development concerned with economic growth, livelihoods, entitlements and capabilities, equity, environmental and ecosystem services, and institutions, 93,94 we put forward an overarching conceptualisation of development that derives from an assessment of existing choices, and a clearer articulation of the relation of ends In 1992, Zambia began implementing Health Sector Reform, with the vision to \"provide the people of Zambia with equity of access to cost-eff ective, quality healthcare as close to the family as possible\" guided by the NHSP. Although the 2001-05 NHSP reaffi rmed the health vision, principles, and overall health goals of the Health Sector Reforms, 61 the theme adopted for the 2006-10 NHSP was entitled \"Towards the Attainment of the Millennium Development Goals and National Health Priorities\", indicating close alignment with the MDGs. 62 This alignment is refl ected in the fact that seven of the 12 national health priorities focused on public health priorities whereas fi ve directly addressed the three health MDGs. 63 However, although these priority areas were specifi cally singled out for special attention, the NHSP did include other health-care interventions.Zambia\\'s strategic alignment with the MDGs has benefi ted from the increased donor support for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria that was received in the fi rst decade of the 21st century. The availability of fi nancial and technical resources from donors such as the Global Fund, the President\\'s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the World Bank\\'s Zambia National Response to HIV/AIDS (ZANARA) programme, among others, underpinned to a large extent the progress that has been documented towards attainment of MDG 6 directly. Particularly striking has been the progress made towards achievement of universal access to treatment for HIV/AIDS for all those who need it. By the end of 2008, 200 435 adults were estimated to be receiving antiretroviral drugs, representing 66·3% of the estimated need. 63 However, although the prevalence of HIV fell slightly to 14·3% in 2007 64 compared with 15·6% in 2002, 65 the results of the 2009 epidemiological synthesis study suggest continued transmission of infection, with 1·6% of the adult population becoming newly infected every year. 66 This fi nding implies that to get close to attainment of the 2015 targets there needs to be a renewed focus on prevention of new infections. The National Prevention Strategy articulates the key drivers of the epidemic in Zambia and will guide the prevention eff orts in the next 5 years. 67 Overall, the 2008 National Progress Report on the MDGs suggests that, with the exception of MDG 7, the country is likely or potentially likely to attain the MDGs by 2015. 68 However, continued reliance on external donor support implies that the sector is vulnerable to the global economic climate, as has been experienced in 2009. The ability to maintain any gains in health indicators after 2015 needs planning that will target the long-term sustainable development of the economy. and means. Hence, we are seeking to make operational some of the ideas that Amartya Sen outlines in The Idea of Justice. 95 Sen\\'s argument is that elaboration of a vision of global justice at the present moment, when there are no appropriate institutions to deliver this vision, might be deemed an exercise in ideal theory; however, it is nonetheless important to focus on the choices that are actually on off er in a globally inter-related world, the plurality of principles and inter pretations that might play a part in view of the diff erent histories and contexts of people, and the permissibility of partial resolutions (ie, that making some things a bit better rather than waiting for the best resolution) could be an important step. Sen also emphasises public reasoning and attention to assessment of human lives in terms of capabilitiesie, reasoned values and the signifi cance accorded by these factors.Drawing from this method of assessment of existing human relationships, and identifi cation of means and ends, we defi ne development as a dynamic process involving sustainable and equitable access to improved wellbeing. This conceptualisation needs brief elaboration. There are many elements of wellbeing and increasing published work on its application and measurement. 92, 96, 97 Sen views wellbeing as a combination of the aspiration that \"human lives can go much better\" and an understanding that improvement can be brought about through a strengthening of human agency, a person\\'s capability to pursue and realise things that he or she values and has reason to value. 98 Unlike conventional economics that equate wellbeing with happiness, Sen\\'s capability approach suggests that aspects of wellbeing have to consider the things that we really value (whether they make us happy or not) and levels of deprivation, whether or not people report they are happy despite severe want. By suggesting that wellbeing is linked with capabilities-that is the freedom to enjoy various combinations of beings and doings-Sen draws attention to the signifi cance of how diff erent people necessarily have need of and make use of resources in diverse ways. 97 To consider heterogeneity as part of any evaluation of the freedom people have is therefore crucial. Social arrangements for development are thus to be assessed not in the space of resources (inputs) or of outcomes (happiness) but in relation to wellbeing, agency, and capabilities-that is the freedom to promote and achieve functionings that people value. In adoption of an understanding of wellbeing that derives from Sen\\'s ideas, we defi ne wellbeing as the freedoms and capability to make choices and act eff ectively with respect to, for example, health, education, nutrition, employment, security, participation, voice, consumption, and the claiming of rights. For each of these elements of wellbeing, there are important considerations of quality and quantity of achievement, of diversity in aspirations between diff erent communities, of equity, and in some of these aspects (most notably those concerned with material consumption) of the need to recognise satisfaction from suffi cient (as opposed to maximised) achievement, as diminishing marginal returns to consumption are overtaken by increasing marginal costs (including social costs). This approach helps access to improved wellbeing to be both equitable and sustainable. In this section we will discuss the nature and implications of equity and sustainability, but note here their importance as intrinsic features of our development notion.Sustainable and equitable improvements in wellbeing are achieved by expanding access to services that deliver the diff erent elements of wellbeing. The classifi cation of services provided by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 99 is particularly useful, since it makes a distinction between moderating (or regulating), provisioning, supportive, and cultural services. This typology has wider applicability beyond the provision of The printed journal includes an image merely for illustration ecosystem services by natural capital (eg, forests, soils, wetlands, oceans). Thus physical capital (eg, infrastructure and equipment), human capital (eg, knowledge, skills, labour), and social capital (eg, institutions, relationships) all generate moderating (or regulatory) services that provide stability, promote resilience, and reduce systems\\' sensitivity to change. Similarly, these diff erent types of capital also generate provisioning or productive services (producing goods and services for direct or indirect consumption), supporting services (supporting conditions necessary for and underpinning systems\\' existence and functioning), and cultural services (which provide communicative, aesthetic, recreational, or spiritual benefi ts). Finally, development has to be explicitly and fundamentally seen as a dynamic process of change. This view involves a plurality of perspectives with several stakeholders, who interact as individuals within and between households, organisations, communities, and nations, with diff ering resources and aspirations. Embedded and emergent properties in systems operating at these diff erent scales mean that changes and transformations within them are interdependent and highly complex. 93 This conceptualisation of development extends beyond that implicit in the MDGs, for which MDGs 1-6 in particular are focused on poverty reduction and the achievement of limited, indeed minimalist, standards of welfare, 13 with little emphasis on wider notions of development or on the condition of people who are not affl icted by extreme poverty. Our notion addresses issues that need commitment and action across countries of low, middle, and high income. In view of the arbitrary nature of the cutoff points in many classifi cations of poor and non-poor people, and the moral arguments that all people have an equal right to aspire to much more than escape from narrow and arbitrarily defi ned levels of poverty, we believe that development goals should extend beyond, but include, minimalist poverty reduction and survival goals.Our notion also diff ers from the MDGs in another way. Gore 13, 100 has suggested that the development of the present MDGs represented a switch from a procedural approach to development (involving common respect for rules, norms, and practices governing relations) to a distinctly purposive approach, involving the achievement of specifi c, agreed outcomes. Our notion incorporates both of these elements-it is purposive in that it identifi es elements of wellbeing as targets to be achieved, and it is procedural in that it places strong emphasis on equitable, sustainable, owned, and scaled processes. Importantly, it adopts a holistic, maximalist approach while recognising that minimalist standards have a role.However, this broader conceptualisation of development could threaten a core feature of the MDGs that has allowed them, individually and collectively, to achieve a high degree of international consensus and commitment. Only by limiting the scope of the MDGs and accepting gaps resulting from the omission of politically sensitive issues could parsimony and broad agreement be reached. Further, this agreement was reached building on some of the optimistic realignments of the 1990s in the aftermath of the end of the Cold War as a centralised process led by more powerful players with a pragmatic acceptance of the lowest common set of goals and indicators, defi ned to allow sometimes loose and sometimes narrow interpretations. However, any future project to develop the MDGs will be located in a very diff erent global political economy characterised by the events after Sept 11, 2001 , the emergence of a new security agenda, the eff ects of the fi nancial crises, the emergence of China and India as signifi cant economic and geopolitical players, and extreme caution about what global agreements can achieve in view of the failures of the Doha round on trade agreements and the Copenhagen conference on climate change.Building on a broader notion of development should therefore recognise this history and address the dilemma posed by likely trade-off s between a comprehensive set of development goals, and comprehensive commitment to these goals. This approach will not be easy, but several development issues make the MDGs\\' focus on a set of goals aimed at increasing the material consumption of poor people less tenable. We draw attention to, for example, a growing acceptance of the need to address population growth, to recognise and restrict the environmental eff ect of human activities, and to understand the limitations of growth based on capitalism and neo-liberalism as a system for delivery of sustainable development. These issues have been ones for which comprehensive agreement is diffi cult to obtain from states with diff erent ideologies and political systems, but they can no longer be avoided. Unterhalter and Carpentier 101 set out this challenge in terms of a so-called development tetralemma faced in the pursuit of mechanisms and systems that simultaneously promote equity, growth, democracy, and sustainability (in which a tetralemma is defi ned as analogous to a dilemma, but involving a set of four crucially important options for which each is necessary but not suffi cient for sustainable development, and they cannot all be achieved together). Almost all present political and economic mechanisms and systems can only achieve some of these at the expense of others; hence they are compromised even in their initial achievements. Experience of the Copenhagen negotiations in December, 2009, on climate change targets and measures shows the diffi culties in getting international agreements on complex and politically sensitive issues aff ecting international and intergenerational investments and concerned with countries\\' diff ering and evolving domestic aspirations and perceptions of rights and responsibilities. 102, 103 Guiding principles for development goalsWe suggest that a more comprehensive concept for development should and can form the basis of a development project after 2015, if that project follows fi ve guiding principles. We derive these principles from our development notion above, and from our analysis in part 2 of the MDGs\\' strengths and weaknesses. They are: holism, equity, sustainability, ownership, and global obligation. We examine each of these in turn, but emphasise that they are not independent of each other, but closely interwoven.\\n\\nHolism\\n\\nBy holism we mean the need to avoid gaps in a development agenda and realise synergies between its components. We emphasised in part 2 of this report both gaps in the MDGs and the way that their separation contributes to a failure to achieve integration and synergy between the elements that contribute to improved wellbeing. Figure 1 shows how this tenet can be viewed in terms of three core dimensions of wellbeing. It suggests that people\\'s wellbeing and capabilities depend on human development (change in their individual human conditions and resources), social development (change in their social relations and resources), and environmental development (change in their access to and relations with natural and environmental resources). Progress on each of these areas is crucial for people\\'s wellbeing, but they are also closely related to and dependent on each other. A formulation of development goals should start from these individual and interlinked dimensions. We also note that achievement of human, social, and environmental development as set out in fi gure 1 is dependent on underpinning development of physical capital and, in view of the global challenges noted earlier, population stabilisation. Neither of these are themselves core dimensions of wellbeing, but both are important for human, social, and environmental development.The general identifi cation of human, social, and environmental development as core dimensions for achievement of wellbeing is important for a holistic conceptualisation of development processes and outcomes, but it is too broad to be a practicable focus for development policy and action. For this approach we need to consider more specifi c elements that are necessary means and ends to achieve contributors to human, social, and environmental development and, as a result, wellbeing. These factors could be confi gured in many ways. By means of illustration, we present one set in fi gure 2.Some of these elements clearly resemble existing MDGs. Some are presented diff erently to address some of the weaknesses that we have identifi ed in the MDGseg, the lack of focus on learning, and the lack of the integration of health areas. Others represent areas excluded from the MDGs, such as human rights. An important feature of each of these elements is that it contributes directly or indirectly to human, social, and environmental development. The elements are holistic and interlinked and represent areas in which we can realistically in Sen\\'s terms \"do more and do better\". 104 Access to water, for example, delivers human, social, and environmental elements of wellbeing, through water for drinking and sanitation, societal agreements on water sharing and use, and sustainable use of watersheds and management of pollution, respectively.The absence of explicit reference to economic development or growth or to markets from fi gures 1 and 2 is not intended to suggest that economic growth is not important in development. Indeed it is crucial for funding investments in the delivery of services for most of the elements in fi gure 2, and underpins participation in and enjoyment of livelihoods (and employment) by which people both contribute to and access services from the local and wider communities of which they are a part. However, the dimensions and elements of development in fi gures 1 and 2 are higher level development ends, in whose pursuit economic development and growth are important means. Furthermore, the importance, nature, and extent of economic growth, and the roles of markets, governments, and other institutions (eg, civil society) in achievement of these ends are context specifi c. Thus growth is less important in more wealthy economies, where more attention might be needed for issues of sustainability and reducing the negative eff ects of material consumption on the environment. In poorer economies, however, economic growth is likely to be more important.We present the elements in fi gure 2 as indicative. They might not describe all the essential elements contributing to wellbeing, or they could be confi gured or combined better-any changes or additions need to be considered in a similarly interlinked approach. Further, we do not propose these elements as a list of future MDGs. In view of experience so far, expansion of MDGs from eight to 13, and adding the targets and indicators that achieved the linkages intended, might considerably weaken the virtue Overarching ends Dimensions of parsimony in attracting public attention and fi nancial investment (although the pursuit of synergies might also allow some reduction in targets per goal).Prioritisation would be a process with a strong political element, as with the existing MDGs. We emphasise here that any selection of priorities for targeting should be done through an approach that identifi es the elements that deliver most human, social, and environmental development, and, in subselecting from these elements, recognise and accommodate as best as possible the gaps that will arise and the linkages that such gaps might threaten. We suggest that this approach would be better than assembling specifi c, independent goals to make a development agenda, as was done with the present MDGs, with retrospective fi lling in of gaps and making of linkages-a process that has had limited success because of complexity and lack of ownership.Another aspect of a holistic approach to development goal setting concerns operational choices in delivery of services. In this approach, holism suggests that there has to be the opportunity for co-action across elements and synergies in relation to service access for individuals and communities. The absence of this, for example, with interventions in health in one part of a country and interventions in education in another, could contribute to marginal, sectoral increases in wellbeing, but fail to capture the added gains from joint investments in education and health in the same groups of people (eg, improved health services reduce children\\'s absences from school and improve their participation and concentration at school, while education can improve uptake of health services).However, we realise that one practical consequence of this operational application of the principle of holism might be a potential confl ict with our principle of equity.Undertaking a series of intervention programmes addressing diff erent areas for action in the same localities with the same households could yield large benefi ts for these households and communities. However, it would be unfair and inequitable if at the same time other poor localities missed out on all interventions because resources were insuffi cient. Thus, to continue with our example above, added investment in education in one part of the country and added investment in health in another might seem to be more equitable, but such equity might be achieved at the cost of losses in eff ectiveness and effi ciency. Nonetheless, working with Sen\\'s advocacy of partial resolutions submitted for public scrutiny might allow for these rationales to be assessed. 94 \\n\\nSustainability\\n\\nSustainability was not explicitly or implicitly addressed in the MDGs, apart from in MDG 7 from the perspective of environmental sustainability and sustainable development. These two diff erent notions-the fi rst relating to protection of ecosystem function and services, and the second to economic growth that protects the opportunities of future generations 107 -are important features of a comprehensive development concept. However, sustainable wellbeing is broader than both these ideas.We defi ne sustainability of a system that delivers an outcome, such as wellbeing, in terms of its capacity to persist, and to resist or recover from shocks that aff ect its productivity. 108 Sustainability is an important feature of the diff erent development dimensions and elements identifi ed earlier; economic and fi nancial sustainability arises particularly from processes of social development, and from human and environmental development. Sustainable action should be a practice of all stakeholders who have power over the resources a system uses, and it will apply to all scales (eg, from households to nations, from fi elds and small stream catchments to river basins). Such sustainable action is hard to achieve, but is made easier when diff erent services can substitute for each other to improve sustainability. For example, the sustainability of nutrition as an element of wellbeing can be supported by development of improved agricultural and environmental systems, by improved trade and the equitable distribution of foodstuff s, or by changes in personal livelihoods or behaviour that give individuals more reserves to survive periods of want. And sustainable wellbeing depends on children and young people learning how to learn in order to make full use of improved agricultural, environmental, and distribution systems, and to develop resistance to shocks in health and income in the future.A broad but clear understanding of the role of productivity is crucial to understand sustainability. Productivity needs to be defi ned in terms of a system\\'s delivery of the provisioning, supportive, regulating, and cultural services that we discussed earlier. Not only does productivity have to be viable in material terms (not depleting resources below stocks needed for the system to operate), it also has to be both viable and acceptable in social and economic terms. Therefore, all stakeholders with (formal or informal) control over resources need to have the ability and incentives to support the maintenance of the system. We draw attention to two implications from this tenet. First, growth in productivity is crucial for the sustainability of many systems, but not a necessary feature of all systems, and the nature and rate of growth needed in a system will vary with the aspirations of stakeholders, changing pressures on systems, and socioeconomic structures and relations. Thus increasing population and aspirations for substantial improvements in wellbeing for poor people makes strong demands for productivity growth, but economic growth associated with increases in material consumption will not be as important for some advanced economies and their sustainability. This notion brings us back to our discussion in part 2 of this report of targets and the important, but widely misunderstood, distinction between global and national targets. Although the sustainability of the planet needs substantial reductions in productivity growth globally, the poorest countries might need to achieve high productivity growth to raise the incomes of the poorest. Second, both equity and ownership are needed in the management of systems and the returns that they off er to diff erent stakeholders. Failure of crucial stakeholders to perceive that they or others benefi t fairly from a system will lead to their withdrawal of resources from that system and its eventual collapse. The requirements of sustainability are therefore inextricably linked with our other principles of holism, equity, ownership, and global obligation.\\n\\nGlobal obligation\\n\\nThe experience of 10 years of work on the MDGs raises serious issues for debate about global justice, both as an important area of normative discussion and in terms of institution building and practical politics. Commitment to the MDGs implicitly or explicitly involved commitments to large transfers of resources from developed to developing economies and, in MDG 8, commitments to address inequities in structural relations between countries. However, despite delivery of the resources needed to achieve some MDGs, relations between developed and developing countries are largely characterised by unmet political and fi nancial commitments from developed countries. These commitments can be attributed to a failure by political leaders and voters to recognise and own international development obligations.The question of what the nature of our obligation is to people who are not citizens of our country raises a range of complex philosophical and political challenges. 111, 112 In a particular country citizens share a government and many political, economic, cultural, and social relationships that make up everyday life. The areas of MDG focus-income, nutrition, education, health provision, water, and housing-are all areas that became the focus of state policy and practical intervention in the 20th century. Thus governments became a key locus of obligation for social protection.But there is also a long history of civil society concern with people who live beyond national borders. Global ties of affi liation take in members (or intended members) of a particular faith community, and members of a group connected by attachment to a common language or set of practices. Links beyond local or national boundaries also have connected people aff ected by particular global economic injustices, such as slavery or racism, and those who have been outraged at its practices. Women, who are often discriminated against in their own societies, express the view that they share more with women in other societies than they do their own. This view is polemically captured in Virginia Woolf\\'s statement written in the mid-1930s: \"As a woman I have no country. As a woman my country is the whole world.\"The question of the nature of global obligation in the contemporary world with regard to specifi c present MDG areas (eg, education, health, gender equality) has been much debated, [113] [114] [115] with positions ranging from the need to emphasise national priorities and processes to concerns to establish some intermixture of national decision making and global review that preserves a perspective on adequacy, fairness, and response to discrimination and deprivation. Refl ections on the failure to reach a legally binding agreement on climate change at the UN Summit in Copenhagen, in December, 2009, suggest the diffi culty of establishing truly global agreement regarding obligations beyond boundaries. Further, the focus of Copenhagen was on a subject, climate change, for which global inter-relationship of states was much more evident than can be argued for other aspects of human, social, and environmental development relating to health, livelihoods, learning, energy, etc. Yet nowadays all these elements have global dimensions that link national and local interests-a fact made particularly clear from the recent food security and fi nancial crises. In view of the enormous diffi culties of establishing an institutional architecture at the summit for any ambitious vision of global obligation with regard to climate change and its eff ects, what is the best that can be hoped for the notion of global obligation with regard to the MDGs?We argue for the importance of a position on global obligation that values human rights with respect to human, social, and environmental development. Thus our concerns with wellbeing are not just limited to the obligations we have to citizens of our own country, but to individuals everywhere. 116 However, we would also argue that the expression of these values does not dictate a particular set of responses. Indeed, the form of the response will diff er in diff erent locales, given particular histories, and present form of social and political relationships. In looking forward to a future for development goal setting, we argue for maintaining and deepening the sense of global obligation that they represent. One way to achieve this would be to deepen levels of local and regional ownership of the process. In this way the powerplay and international politicking that was evident at Copenhagen might, to some extent, be reduced.The challenge for taking forward the MDG vision entails not only developing and deepening the normative language of shared obligation on selected areas, but putting in place institutional frames and political processes that can help to build and support this process. Can UN reform address this institutional challenge for global obligation? In January, 2008, Ban Ki-moon outlined leadership on achieving the MDGs as an objective of UN reform. The Secretary-General stressed the importance of improving capacity, developing synergies, and building partnerships, 117 but the politics of achieving these aims has been very complex. The eff ects of the fi nancial crisis and fi scal austerity on the aid budgets that might fi nance this development and on the local resources that might sustain it remain unclear. A further diffi culty is that the UN\\'s hopeful aspirations for human development coexist in a globalised political economy that is marked by substantial inequality and exploitation.Finally, ensuring that the framework is seen as a global framework, rather than just one aff ecting developing countries, is important in setting a future development agenda. It means that all countries, rich and poor, have obligations and subscribe to targets for which they are accountable.\\n\\nThe future of health development goals\\n\\nIn this fi nal section we show the application of our proposed principles to one particular element of wellbeing. We have selected health, since it has been a major feature of the MDGs, being the focus of MDGs 4, 5, and 6, and an element of MDGs 1, 7, and 8. We consider how each of the principles presented in the last section might apply to the development of future health goals. In many cases, what we propose can apply equally to other elements of wellbeing-eg, energy, learning; hence this approach is very much a procedural template for all development goals.A holistic approach to health development Application of our principle of holism to health development would, fi rst, mean a greater focus on the broad health gains that can be realised through an integrated health systems approach, with a better balance between horizontal and vertical features of health action. Key areas of inequity would need particular attention, including those addressed by specifi c, present MDGs. But a more holistic approach is best built on a framework of reasonable health expectations over a lifetime, which would address present gaps and accommodate diff erences in health challenges in diff erent countries.Such a life course approach could identify the following stages and expectations: • Pregnancy: access to antenatal care; adequate maternal nutrition; protection from exposure to dangerous infections and toxins. • Infancy: a reasonable probability of survival coupled with access to a loving parental relationship; protection from death or disability attributable to malnutrition, vaccine-preventable and other infections, trauma, or other causes. • Childhood: quality primary school education; safe space for play at home and school; protection from abuse in the home environment; cognitive and social development; adequate nutrition and protection from both hunger and obesity. • Adolescence: reproductive and sexual health; increasing autonomy; self-respect; access to social security for those with learning diffi culties; fulfi lling potential. • Adulthood: access to care, diagnosis, and treatment for major causes of death and disability (childbirth, noncommunicable diseases, mental health, major infectious diseases); employment opportunities and a social welfare net. • Elderly: social inclusion; dignity in dying; dementia and disability services. These stages would be provided within the framework of a health system encompassing the building blocks of service delivery; health workforce; information; medical products, vaccines, and technologies; fi nancing; and leadership and governance (stewardship). 118 A functioning health system is the sum total of all the organisations, institutions, and resources whose primary purpose is to improve health. It should provide responsive and fi nancially fair preventive and treatment services, and population-based public health activities including community mobilisation in pursuit of health improvement. A new health development agenda would look for parallel requirements between various conditions, and seek to capitalise on synergies. For example, antenatal care services have high coverage in many settings, and are now being used to deliver malaria and HIV services. General support of cross-cutting issues such as fi nancing, governance, accountability, and some elements of human resources and information systems can also include an emphasis on accountability for progress towards spec ifi c conditions.A desirable feature of such a holistic approach with its emphasis on the life course and on the health system is its contribution to synergy with other elements of wellbeing. For example, there is implicit here a greater focus on prevention of poor health, which links with learning in childhood and adolescence in particular, and with the specifi c needs of women. Not only human, but also social and environmental dimensions of wellbeing, would be needed to address health over a life course-eg, the social capacity to provide for elderly people and the environmental capacity to ensure provision of healthy diets and reduced pollution, restricting chronic disease in adulthood.From an operational point of view, holistic health targets and interventions would need to be linked with complementary targets and interventions for other elements of wellbeing, so that these synergies were realised. For example, in the case of learning targets which relate to health, that health and learning programme interventions reach the same groups of people is important. However, educators and health workers do not have to be working alongside each other. Rather, those who plan education and health interventions should work together on how to target diff erent groups, balancing the value of coordinated action with the possibility that the groups most in need of health and education interventions might not be the same.Some interventions need planning at the household, village or local community, region, or country level, and there may for some services be economies of scale in integrated (rather than simply coordinated) service delivery. Planning for learning and health, for example, will generally need collaborative planning involving more than one line authority but a clear division of labour for subsequent implementation. Ongoing monitoring and assessment of progress, however, would often benefi t from some degree of joint action by representatives of more than one group, particularly for identifi cation of the highest risk groups. Evaluation of inequities in this area and monitoring the eff ect of interventions on these inequities should be a joint activity.The Countdown to 2015 initiative, a suprainstitutional collaborative eff ort of concerned individuals and partner organisations, provides a partial model for how linkages can be built. Together with the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health, it attempts to bring together the diverse technical health communities for the constituencies of maternal, newborn, and child health, using a continuum-of-care paradigm. Moreover, within MDGs 4 and 5, it tracks coverage levels for health interventions that are proven to reduce maternal, newborn, and child mortality. A range of indicators are assessed, from mortality eff ects, outcomes such as immunisation coverage, and health inputs (such as emergency obstetric care facilities per population), to policies such as legislation around maternity leave. Equity and health-system indicators are specifi cally addressed.\\n\\nEquity and health\\n\\nWe have identifi ed equity as relating to both intergenerational and intragenerational processes. Applied to health, intergenerational equity involves the recognition, for example, that maternal health contributes to child health, and child health and development to health later in life, including reproductive health. A socalled life course approach described above is one way, therefore, of embedding intergenerational equity in health development, since it places emphasis on actions in one generation that promote the health of subsequent generations. Environmental actions that protect healthrelated ecosystem services-eg, the provision of clean water and air-are particularly important for intergenerational equity because environmental change is so slow and diffi cult to reverse.With respect to intragenerational equity in health development, our aim is to ensure that eff orts to promote human development do not continue to leave behind the most vulnerable and marginalised individuals or communities. Therefore we advocate the use of our growing understanding of equity to focus on the most disadvantaged sections-the equivalent of a pro-poor approach. Wealth quintiles have found useful application to the MDGs, particularly with respect to poverty and health targets. 73, 74 Analyses based on this approach have been instrumental in drawing attention to the extent to which recent progress in many areas has been at the expense of growing inequity. However, when applied nationally, results based on wealth quintiles do not always seem to make sense. Sometimes this situation arises because the key drivers of inequity are factors other than economic poverty, so economic poverty might understate the disparities that exist. At other times they point to fundamental problems with the data itself, such as systematic under-reporting. In some African countries, reported levels of neonatal and infant mortality are substantially lower in the poorest quintiles than some of the wealthier ones. 119 This eff ect is almost certainly due to systematic under-reporting in the poorest and most marginalised groups, who are likely to be suspicious of young data collectors coming from the cities. Adjustment for these eff ects would produce a more accurate, but less welcome estimate of child mortality for the aff ected countries.As we have discussed previously in this report, inequity has many dimensions. Economic inequity (or poverty in its narrowest defi nition) is the most important dimension in many settings, yet it is not always captured by analyses based on wealth. From the perspective of uptake of health services, what really matters is access to cash when it is needed to take care of an unexpected illness in the family. Furthermore, the cash must be accessible for the person taking care of the sick individual-eg, a mother taking care of her child, or a woman needing ongoing treatment for a chronic disease. Too often women do not have access to cash. Thus, gender becomes an important determinant of inequity. Systematic disempowerment of women is a pervasive barrier to development in all areas, most particularly health and education. In some settings, particular ethnic groups are also disadvantaged, and unless this inequity is highlighted and understood, such groups cannot be eff ectively targeted.In some countries, geographical barriers become an important determinant of access to health and education services. Such barriers could be mountains (eg, in Ethiopia, Papua New Guinea), desert (eg, in Niger), or the sea (eg, in many small island communities in the Pacifi c). In large countries such as the Philippines, inequity can be determined diff erently in diff erent regions.To address inequity in health development, therefore, we need to improve understanding of inequities within and between communities, both nationally and subnationally. In some settings socioeconomic factors will be the main determinants of inequity, in terms of education, health, and other areas. In other settings, geographic factors, ethnic origin, or gender can be important determinants of inequity. Simple methods are needed to enable countries to decide which factors are most important for them, and to monitor inequities in health, education, and other areas by monitoring one or more of the key determinants, as interventions are being implemented. Monitoring of inequities in both opportunities and outcomes will enable countries to understand whether existing or future programmes are reducing or indeed increasing inequity. For example, in some countries, a detailed analysis of factors associated with child mortality would likely show that, although socioeconomic factors have a role, with low risk recorded in the wealthiest quintile, a more important determinant of mortality risk is living in an area with no eff ective health services. On the basis of such an analysis, the government might then elect to monitor intervention coverage and mortality in a representative sample of such areas to ensure that as mortality is reduced nationally, the equity gap between the highest risk and lowest risk groups is also narrowed. Structured yearly surveys might be needed to monitor progress.Some countries have consistently adopted a pro-equity approach. For example, Peru targeted the implementation of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI), 120 the WHO/UNICEF strategy to manage sick children, to the highest risk groups 86 -an approach that they have taken with other interventions such as the introduction of a vaccine for Haemophilus infl uenzae type b. Other countries have by contrast chosen to implement IMCI in areas already served by well functioning health systems.A fi nal and challenging feature of equity in health development is the issue of how to distribute scarce resources among a population-eg, for vaccination. Generally, the small number of children living in a very remote area will have high risk of vaccine-preventable disease, particularly diseases for which eff ective health care would greatly reduce the risk of mortality, specifi cally diarrhoeal disease and pneumonia. These issues are even starker when the health services in question are not preventive services that can be delivered through mobile services, but rather treatments that need to be accessed at unspecifi ed times. Here the costs of reaching remote areas with fi xed services can be particularly high, as refl ected in the wide quintile gaps seen for delivery care compared with immunisation, for example. 121 Short of 100% coverage, there are no absolutes. A country might be faced with a real choice of either spending the available funds trying to get 100% coverage, or accepting that 80% is quite good, and electing to use the available funds to introduce a new vaccine, such as that for rotavirus. The utilitarian approach would argue that the net benefi ts are greater if the new vaccine is introduced into the 80% of people already covered, whereas the rights-based approach would argue that the 20% of children have a right to routine vaccines and should be the fi rst priority. At higher levels of coverage this dilemma might become even more diffi cult as the cost of immunising a small number of unimmunised children might become very high, if, for example, a\\n\\nPanel 6: Development of health goals in Thailand beyond the MDGs\\n\\nThailand has achieved almost all the MDG targets well before the 2015 commitment, and introduced a concept of MDG Plus-a set of country-specifi c targets going beyond the international MDG targets. All MDG Plus targets were taken from the agreed targets in the national plans and strategies of line ministries in consultation with all relevant partners. MDG Plus is equity sensitive by going beyond national average goals, making the global MDGs a fl oor instead of a ceiling. By adopting goals and targets that are customised to local needs and priorities, MDG Plus has become a central theme in Thailand\\'s multisectoral human development movements. 122 In 2002, the MDG poverty target of halving, between 1990 and 2015, the percentage of people living in poverty was reached. 123 MDG Plus aimed to bring down poverty incidence further to less than 4% by 2009, and the continuing trend of poverty reduction suggests this target was achievable despite the unforeseen global economic crisis of 2008-09. Additionally, the percentage of people living below the food poverty line and the prevalence of the underweight in children younger than 5 years have exceeded the 2015 targets since the early 2000s. MDG Plus gave special attention to children in northern highland provinces, where there are higher rates of malnutrition, and shifted focus from protein and energy defi ciency, which were not problems, to micronutrient defi ciency and in particular iodine, iron, and vitamin A in school children.There are several lessons on how Thailand achieved the health-related MDGs and moved beyond them. The commitment of successive governments since the 1970s in investing in the health of the population, and consistent favourable economic growth, were the main determinants of the development of health-system infrastructure. 124 Huge investment in the district health system, and eff orts to protect poor and underprivileged people from catastrophic health-care costs through targeting approaches from 1975, replaced by a policy of universal coverage in 2002, contributed substantially to health achievement in both level and distribution. 125, 126 Functioning primary health care was an outcome of the national policy of extending rural health services to all subdistricts and districts, and of the policy from the 1970s of compulsory rural health services for all medical and nursing graduates. District health systems serve as a close-to-client service hub that is accessible to the vast majority of rural poor people, as refl ected in various indicators: 98% coverage of antenatal care that facilitated rapid nationwide scaling up of the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV programme within a year in 2001, 73% prevalence of modern contraceptive use, and 98% immunisation coverage of DTP3 (third dose of diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and pertussis vaccine). 127 Universal access results in very small rich-poor and urban-rural gaps of use of maternal and child health services, 128 which is a key contributor to MDG 4 and MDG 5. In 2009, more than 150 000 people living with HIV were enrolled in the universal antiretroviral programme provided by district health providers.Empirical evidence shows the equitable outcomes of the universal coverage scheme launched in 2002. For example, the tax-fi nanced universal coverage scheme is progressive, with rich people contributing a greater share of their income than poor people. The comprehensive benefi t package, free at the point of service, has produced a very low incidence of catastrophic health expenditure and impoverishment. 129 Recent inclusion of renal dialysis in the package has fostered poverty reduction. 130 Without the extensive district health system, the universal coverage policy would be mere rhetoric, in which citizen rights were ensured only on paper and poor people would be unable to access and use services.In conclusion, Thailand benefi ted from rapid economic growth and government commitment to human development to achieve the MDGs early. Eff orts are in place to ensure that development is achieved universally through locally defi ned MDG Plus goals and targets. Lessons from Thailand show that the MDGs were achieved through sustainable health-system development. Wide geographical coverage of functioning primary health care at district and subdistrict levels, and the adoption of the universality principle, are major contributors to the achievement of the health-related MDs in Thailand.helicopter is needed to reach some small isolated settlements. This dilemma is familiar to health offi cials in developing countries. Although there might be no right or wrong answers, a real analysis of the costs and benefi ts of various approaches would empower countries to make more reasoned decisions.\\n\\nOwnership and health\\n\\nThe ownership processes that we suggested above, involving integration of local, national, and regional priorities to generate national, regional, and global targets, would apply well to health and to other elements of wellbeing. On the basis of agreed health objectives in the life course, decisions could be made nationally about how these would be prioritised, on the basis of national needs and opportunities, through a process involving, ideally, local government and civil society.Goal design and setting would benefi t in some cases from support to national programmes to analyse and understand the determinants of poor health outcomes, providing such programmes with the instruments needed for truly evidence-based decision making to set priorities in health. Thus, in the area of child survival, decisions would then be less easily dominated by pressure from special interest groups, or the particular preferences of funding agencies. When a reasoned analysis based on real and valid data has indicated the most suitable approach for a country to take, donors and outside pressure groups will need to take notice. The same support would help nations to develop their own, most eff ective and appropriate indicators and methods to monitor progress. Useful models for such national ownership and development of health goals can be found in the experiences of governments that have made use of, and improved on, existing MDGs. Panel 6 shows an example of such a model in Thailand.\\n\\nGlobal obligation and health\\n\\nExercising global obligation in health development would need a commitment by wealthy countries to supporting poorer countries to improve health-service provision and thereby improve global equity of access to improved health outcomes. Donor funding would be an element, and is an important feature of the present MDGs. We suggest that more attention needs to be focused on the interactions between wealthy and poor countries that constrain poor countries from improving their own health outcomes. These interactions include addressing patterns of training and employment of health workers internationally that leaves poorer countries paying for training of health workers who then settle in wealthier countries. They also include strengthening of science and innovation systems in poorer countries so that they might play a more equitable part in developing and benefi ting from new health services and technologies. This support for developing countries might mean a greater local role in public-private partnerships for medicines development, particularly in the use of local natural resources and indigenous knowledge for development of new treatments. Or it could mean strengthening disease surveillance systems and their ownership by poorer countries to reduce their disproportionate burden of infectious diseases while improving global health security to prevent future disease pandemics.Most interventions such as these would be of mutual benefi t to all countries, improving access by all to health care and medicines. Their achievement could involve targeting based less on thresholds for specifi c outcomes in poorer countries and more on demonstrable adoption and successful implementation of policies that support equitable outcomes for all countries. In this context, work done by the World Bank on environmental policy targets for MDG 7 might be a useful model. 44 \\n\\nSustainability and health\\n\\nTo achieve the holistic expectations considered above throughout the life course needs several interlinked systems to function eff ectively. It also needs suffi cient reliable and continual funding. Over the past 17 years, there have been various attempts to calculate the costs of scaled up health care, including the Essential Health Care Package approach introduced in the World Bank\\'s World Development Report 1993, the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health 131 that addressed the health development fi nance needs for countries below a gross national product of $1200 per head, and the 2009 High Level Taskforce on Innovative International Financing for Health Systems that was concerned with all low-income countries. The Commission on Macroeconomics and\\n\\nReuters\\n\\nThe printed journal includes an image merely for illustrationHealth estimated a 2002 cost of $38 per head for a scaled up set of essential interventions for low-income countries in 2015, and calculated that $4 per head on average would need to come from external funding. The Taskforce undertook a much more comprehensive costing, and estimated a 2005 cost of $54 per head for scaled up services in 2015, with around $9 to come from external fi nancing on the assumption that donor countries lived up to their commitments to development assistance. 33, 34, 132 Both sets of analyses made assumptions on desirable levels of domestic support to health that greatly exceed present levels of government health expenditure. In view of present rates of economic growth and continuing population expansion, sustained development assistance for health and considerable additional domestic fi nance are needed if we are to move towards the collective national and international aspirations for health even over the next decades. Most health expenditure in low-income countries still comes from private, mostly out-of-pocket payments (mean of $13 per head in 2006), with domestic government budgets contributing an average of $12, and development assistance making a smaller but important contribution of $6. 33 The goal of the above health intervention and system strengthening initiatives is to plan, design, and build an effi cient, equitable, and responsive health system without the distorting eff ects and special pleading of particular interest groups. Sector-wide approaches to fi nancing encourage all interested partners, both domestic governmental and external investors, to pool their resources so that one health plan can be implemented, monitored, and reported upon. The challenge that has arisen in some countries is that when domestic budgets are tightened, and external donors do not meet their expected contributions, there are not enough resources for all. In this situation the fi xed recurrent costs, particularly salaries, still have to be met, and as a result funds for services and commodities are unavailable, leading to shortages and stock-outs even for those activities that are seen as key priorities within the plan. Thus, proponents of specifi c interventions-such as vaccination for children, or completion of tuberculosis treatment to prevent emergence of costly drug resistance-have good grounds to advocate for protected funding for a few key programmes. And so we rapidly fall back into the same discussion of disease-specifi c programmes in tension with broader system-wide strengthening of the building blocks of the health system.To escape this dichotomy, we need to move the debate beyond the fi nancial sustainability of individual countries\\' health budgets. Sustainability has to be linked to global obligation and solidarity that allows rational planning with the assumption that funding will be predictable, reliable, and increasing every year. The declarations made by governments of both rich and poor countries have to be upheld. Sub-Saharan African countries have committed to increase expenditure on health to 15% of general government expenditure, and almost all rich countries have committed to raising their development assistance to 0·7% of their gross national income as well as giving commitments to specifi c goals such as universal access to treatment for HIV, which remains a target for MDG 6 for this year. 33 Unless governments deliver on these commitments, aspirations for the holistic interpretation that we put on health and development will remain mere dreams.Sustainability for the health sector can also be considered in terms that go beyond fi nancial security, to guide investment towards areas that lead to stronger human, physical, and social capital and that build systems more likely to resist or recover from the shocks that aff ect their productivity. 108 For example, large amounts of external investment fl ow into expensive technical assistance, whereas a more sustainable approach might see that investment channelled into building local and regional expertise that could eventually replace the external support.The Global Fund now supports a large proportion of the millions of people living in the poorest countries who are taking antiretroviral therapy, and there is increasing concern about maintaining donor commitments to universal access in view of the economic uncertainties. Countries are encouraged to submit proposals that show the potential for sustainability. This criterion is expanded to encompass, among other criteria, proposals that show high-level, sustained political involvement and commitment, strengthening the various elements of national health systems, and strengthening of civil society and community systems in its diff erent components (eg, management capacity, service delivery, and infra structure), with an emphasis on key aff ected populations.The so-called killer diseases of MDG 6 are all infectious diseases, which leads to one further aspect of sustainability and health-namely, the possibility of eradication of infectious pathogens. A strong case can be made for disproportionate and unsustainable investment if there is a realistic chance that in the longer term such investment will lead to eradication of a disease and consequent gains in wellbeing (and reductions in ongoing costs). The eradication of smallpox from the world and the recent success in elimination of severe acute respiratory syndrome from human populations are notable triumphs led by WHO. However, expensive campaigns against poliomyelitis that disrupt community health services have seen recent set-backs, and the shift from control to elimination of malaria has been argued in Africa to be \"at best irrelevant and at worst counterproductive\". 133 For HIV there are ambitious mathematical models suggesting that major investment in testing and early treatment could lead to overall savings in the future by reducing transmission. 134 Thus sustainability for infectious diseases might have a diff erent tenor to sustainability for health in general, for which we need to plan for ongoing and expanding costs that can be met only by a concerted and planned eff ort to draw on both domestic and external fi nance, including from innovative sources. 34 This is especially the case as the non communicable disease burden rises as the epidemiological transition proceeds.\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nIn application of our development principles to health elements of wellbeing, we would envisage future health development goals that are focused on sustainable health systems, built around delivering health objectives across the life course. This objective would involve close linkage with learning, economic, social, and environmental elements necessary to achieving these objectives, which themselves could involve other goal development processes based on elements of improved wellbeing. From a procedural perspective, these health objectives would be agreed by international consensus, and how they were then developed into goals would be a process led at the national level, building through dialogue to a set of regional and global goals. We suggest that such goals avoid threshold-based targets and indicators that might increase inequity and instead aim to generate wellbeing for all, while taking a proactive, pro-poor approach. Global cooperation would emphasise supporting countries to achieve goals in more diverse ways than simply donor funding. Sustainability would be incorporated through a high degree of national ownership and ongoing investment in human, social, and physical capital.\\n\\nContributors\\n\\nMembers of the Lancet-LIDC Commission contributed to the development of the structure of the report, writing and commenting on drafts.

Among them are included novel agents such as HIV and the human variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (2) , re-emerging organisms such as those responsible for outbreaks of viral hemorragic fevers (VHF) in Africa (3) (4) (5) , as well as those related to bioterrorism such as the deliberate release of anthrax in the U.S. (6) . Moreover, expanding international travel has enhanced the movement and the speed of diffusion of infectious agents, as dramatically demonstrated by the epidemic observed in 2003 due to the novel SARS-associated coronavirus (7, 8) .Agents with a potential severe and pandemic impact such as the avian influenza virus H5N1 currently circulating in Asia are under surveillance (9) (10) (11) . Almost all of these infectious diseases have a significant link to the hospital setting that often represents the case of resonance for community epidemic events. Hospitals serve as important settings for identification of these threatening agents and play important roles in addressing these threats.The objective of this article is to briefly describe the model of hospital response for early diagnosis and prompt management of patients with highly contagious infectious diseases, their recognition in case of clustering among hospitalized patients, and the infection control procedures to minimize the risk for the healthcare workers and the spread to the community. Moreover, the model of a referral hospital for the management of highly contagious diseases will be presented.\\n\\nRecognition and Surveillance\\n\\nPrompt recognition and identification is the initial and indispensable step in facing any communicable disease, regardless of whether it is a prevalent, a newly emerging one or deliberately released. Whether in the community or in the hospital setting, early detection of the occurrence of any communicable or infectious diseases rests on the primary healthcare worker who recognizes the first unusual patients. Indeed, before any response can be mounted, the event has to be detected, recognized and then identified as requiring special action. Detection requires clinical awareness, timely surveillance and often cleverness.The importance of developing and implementing nontraditional methods of public health surveillance has been recently highlighted in view of the increasing concern related to the emergence and re-emergence of naturally occurring or deliberately delivered transmissible diseases.Several surveillance systems have been proposed. Advantages and disadvantages of these different systems have been previously reviewed (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) .Apart from ongoing surveillance systems, several of the recent outbreaks were first suspected and brought to the attention of the public health officials by astute clinicians who identified a cluster of cases among in-patients and an epidemiological or microbiological or clinical link between these cases.Several recent major outbreaks have been brought to the attention of public health authorities when unusual clustering of illness was recognized in hospitalized patients. This was the case of the recognition of unusual incidence of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia among in-patients that prompted the identification of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s (17) .After the 1976 outbreak of Legionella infections in Philadelphia (18) , several outbreaks were identified, thanks to the recognition of unusual clustering, including an outbreak occurring on a passenger cruise ship (19) .In the outbreak of Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in 1993 in the southwestern U.S. (20) , a clustering of cases was observed by the Indian Health Service, and physicians were requested to report cases meeting the clinical case definition that was adopted.In the large outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections in the state of Washington, recognition by the hospitalization of multiple patients with hemolytic-uremic syndrome was crucial, and public health surveillance through statemandated reporting of E. coli O157:H7 infection as was carried out in the state of Washington was critical for prompt outbreak recognition and control (21) .Hospital administrators should be aware of the need for establishing hospital surveillance aimed at early detection of cases and clusters of severe unexplained infections that might signal the emergence or re-emergence of public threat. Focus of this kind of surveillance is represented by transmissible diseases clustering and by novel or unusual illnesses, even as sporadic case. Unusual illness may (a) occur in patients presenting with signs or symptoms that do not fit any recognizable clinical picture, (b) be of known etiology but not usually expected to occur in a specific geographical area or setting where it has been observed, (c) show unexpected behavior, e.g., failure to respond to standard therapy, or (d) be of unknown etiology.An outbreak is said to occur where the number of cases observed is greater than the number expected over a given time period, and cases are linked by epidemiological or microbiological features.Whenever hospital health professionals are involved with cases of an unusual illness, reporting to national authorities should follow local regulations. Certain prescribed diseases, including cholera and yellow fever, are subject to the International Health Regulations reporting guidelines. The local health authority forwards the initial report to the next superior jurisdiction.A system that allows a wide and immediate dissemination of information and exchange of views on risk assessment and risk management is crucial for timely public health action. In this regard, an important lesson derived from the multicountry outbreak of SARS. The disease originated in November 2002 from Guandong province in China and emerged only after some months when the World Health Organization (WHO) launched an international alert in February 2003. Soon after the alert, as a direct result of globalization, several countries and regions notified of cases of SARS.As of July 2003, when the WHO announced the containment of the epidemic, a total of 8,500 cases and 916 deaths had been reported; the major impact was sustained by southeast Asian countries and Canada. The severe consequences of the few months lost because of delayed notification have been stressed by the exceptional results obtained after the international community become aware of the SARS threat. Indeed, the prompt identification of a novel coronavirus as the etiologic agent of SARS and the implementation of hospital-based, national and international control measures demonstrated the power of coordinated integration of efforts and capabilities and of shared information.As the first epidemic ended, scattered new cases have been promptly reported, and a surveillance system proposed to promptly highlight a possible re-emergence of the disease (22) (23) (24) (25) .In the last years a great opportunity derived from the exploitation of the speed and ubiquity of the Internet to serve as an early warning system for the detection of emerging disease outbreaks. Several web sites are available to help health professionals and consumers find current, accurate information on the topic and should be consulted daily by dedicated hospital personnel (26) (27) (28) . In fact, the World Wide Web provides a plethora of information on infectious diseases; unfortunately, not all of it is reliable.Examples of widely used, timely and reliable Web sites are those from the WHO and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA (CDC). A useful tool is represented by the International Society for Infectious Diseases Web site, Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED).ProMED receives reports on outbreaks or unusual cases of infectious diseases, whether natural or intentionally released, that affect humans, animals and plants. Reports are carefully screened for validity and are placed in an appropriate context by commentary and references from a panel of expert moderators. Reports are then posted to the Web and available to users free of charge (29) .Another pillar of international infectious diseases control is the European Network for the Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases and its Early Warning and Response System (EWRS http://webgate.cec.eu.int/ewrs/). The EWRS is a telematic system linking the designated authorities in Member States and the Commission, to alert public health authorities on outbreaks with greater than national dimensions, so that a co-ordinated European Union (EU) action may be required.The Decision No. 2119/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 December 1999 on the early warning and response system for the prevention and control of communicable makes it clear that all events that could lead to outbreaks of EU-wide significance should be reported under the EWRS irrespective of whether or not a disease-specific network at EU level has been set up. Depending on the specific situation, the Commission and Member States agree on the appropriate action to be taken individually or together. The system allows for immediate exchange of views on risk assessment and risk management crucial for timely public health action (30) .A non-negligible issue of the outbreak management attains to communication to public opinion through media. Indeed, outbreaks are frequently marked by uncertainty, confusion and a sense of urgency. The overriding public health goal is to bring the outbreak under control as quickly as possible, with as little social disruption as possible.Effective outbreak communication is one tool to achieve that goal. Unfortunately, examples abound of communication failures that have undermined public trust and compliance, as well as unnecessarily prolonged economic, social and political turmoil (31, 32) . As part of hospital preparedness and management planning, an outbreak communication plan should be ready from the start.The WHO believes it is now time to acknowledge that communication expertise has become as essential to outbreak control as epidemiological training and laboratory and recently issued specific guidelines to manage public and media outbreak communication (33) .\\n\\nInitial Management of Hospitalized Cases\\n\\nThe case definition developed by health authorities at the beginning of an alert represents the first tool that a hospital should adopt in order to implement timely and appropriate diagnostic, clinical and infection control measures.Of intuitive primary importance in this regard is the role of hospital emergency departments that may be the first link where suspected patients related to an alert can refer, as well as the first to recognize unusual illness (16, 34, 35) .Moreover, high-quality clinical microbiology laboratories capability should be available on site or identified as referral labs for the timeliness of diagnosis, and early detection of infectious disease outbreaks should be addressed. Proper specimen collection, transport, nucleic acid processing, molecular assay diagnostic reagent and equipment development, and standardization for sensitive and rapid detection of bioagents in blood and other clinical samples should be addressed. Combinations of appropriate diagnostic technologies (culture, immunoassay, and molecular assay) can provide rapid diagnostic response capabilities to microbial threats with antimicrobial resistant organisms, new emerging infectious disease agents, and possible agents of bioterrorism (36) (37) (38) .Decisional algorithms for the diagnostic management of suspected, probable or confirmed cases should be developed taking into account available knowledge. Concerns that unusual or eradicated diseases might reappear and limited clinical experience with their diagnosis prompted many clinicians to design clinical algorithms. An algorithm is a step-by-step instruction for solving a problem. Several algorithms have been proposed for emerging and re-emerging highly contagious infectious diseases.In the case of smallpox, Seward et al. used clinical features of classic smallpox to classify persons presenting with suspected smallpox rashes into three categories: those with high, those with moderate, and those with low risk of having smallpox. The classification guides subsequent diagnostic strategies, limiting smallpox laboratory testing to high-risk persons to minimize the number of false-positive test results. In their experience at CDC, the algorithm worked well to guide clinical and public health responses to suspected smallpox cases and was recommended elsewhere (39) .For inhalational anthrax (IA), an algorithm seems more difficult to design because the decision criteria should be based on the limited knowledge of the clinical presentation in the reported cases for the literature. Hupert et al.proposed a method to screen for IA by quantifying differences in clinical presentation between IA anthrax and common viral respiratory tract infections. Review of case reports of IA and epidemiologic studies of influenza and other viral respiratory infections were used for this purpose. In their study, IA had characteristic clinical features distinct from those seen in common viral respiratory tract infections.Screening protocols based on these features might, therefore, improve rapid identification of patients with presumptive IA in the setting of a large-scale anthrax attack (40) .On the other hand, Mayer et al. proposed to modify the CDC-issued interim guidelines for clinical evaluation of persons with possible IA (41) on the basis of the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings of the 11 patients with bioterrorism-related IA during their first visit to a physician. Whereas the CDC guidelines would not have identified 10/11 of these patients, the proposed extensions of the guidelines retrospectively identified 8/11 of the patients with IA (42) . In a recent article, Howell et al. compared the two methods proposed to screen for IA, applying them to the emergency department charts of patients who presented with possible signs or symptoms of IA at a hospital. Applying the Mayer criteria would have identified both patients with IA and would have generated fewer charges than applying the Hupert criteria ($13,325 vs. $126,025 USD) (43) .In the early phase of the SARS epidemic, given the nonspecific presentation of the disease and lack of diagnostic methods, case definitions were proposed that combined epidemiological and clinical features (44, 45) . When a diagnostic tool became available, this was incorporated in a panel of laboratory assays to be used in case of high suspicion of SARS (46) .A similar approach that takes into account a complete panel of classic lab methods and biomolecular assays should be adopted in case of diseases characterized by a syndromic presentation, such as respiratory and diarrheal illnesses (47) .An epidemiological (mostly the geographical area of interested by the outbreak), clinical and laboratory-based case definition should be adopted for the purpose of surveillance and management of VHF suspected cases, as well as contacts (48) .In the U.S., the CDC provides support to local health care institutions, including hospitals, in case of national and international needs. With a similar aim, in Spring 2004 the Council and the European Parliament adopted enabling legislation to create a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). This new EU agency will provide a structured and systematic approach to the control of communicable diseases and other serious health threats that affect European Union citizens. The ECDC will also mobilize and significantly reinforce the synergies among the existing national centres for disease control (49) .\\n\\nHospital Isolation Measures\\n\\nWhenever the alert is done, the hospital infection control unit should be promptly notified in order to organize an appropriate response and management.A crucial step in the containment of an outbreak in a hospital is the implementation of proper isolation procedures. Each health care institution should have issued protocols to implement standard as well as transmission-based precautions, as recommended by health care-associated infection control guidelines (50) .These protocols should be reinforced all over the hospital in the case of national and international alert, also through educational initiatives, and integrated with specific recommendations issued by International Health authorities. For example, a new addition to the recommendations for Standard Precautions is called Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette, and grew out of observations during the SARS epidemic for a better control of droplet transmission of communicable diseases in the hospital setting with particular regard to the emergency and triage areas (51, 52) .Finally, surveillance of healthcare and laboratory workers exposed to highly transmissible patients or specimens and post-exposure protocols must be issued as an essential component of hospital response. In this context, the WHO has recommended the implementation of a SARS alert system in the post-epidemic period that involves surveillance of clustered cases of pneumonia among healthcare workers (HCW). This proposal is based on the consideration that occupational transmission among HCW has been a striking feature of the SARS outbreak (24) .Similar recommendations were also issued by the CDC (53). A plan for referral of suspected or confirmed cases of highly contagious and public threatening infectious diseases to a hospital provided with a higher infection control capability should be implemented, when necessary.A model for the initial hospital response to an epidemic in a referral center \"Lazzaro Spallanzani\" National Institute for Infectious Diseases, Rome, Italy has been identified by the Italian Ministry of Health as the national referral center for the management of patients affected by highly transmissible infectious disease, including naturally transmitted diseases and cases of deliberate release of biological agents (54) .The Institute consists of a modern three-floor acute care hospital complex and two buildings where research and laboratory facilities are located. The hospital has 256 beds in seven wards, 48 beds in day hospital care, and 20 intensive care beds. All wards are provided with single or double rooms, with an air conditioning system that is able to provide up to 12 air changes per hour. All rooms have private baths and a fully equipped anteroom and are equipped with wellsealed doors and HEPA filter on the incoming as well as exhausted air flow. The anterooms contain supplies for routine patient care, protective barriers for personnel and hand washing facility. Moreover, the system also allows changes from negative to positive room pressure and vice versa, in order to use the rooms for airborne isolation or as a protective environment. All rooms are potentially suitable for isolation or cohorting according to adopted airborne, droplet and/or contact precautions.In addition, a high isolation unit has been created for the management of sporadic cases of highly contagious infectious diseases such as VHF or smallpox. The unit consists of two private rooms and a biosafety level (BSL) 3 laboratory. Inside the hospital building, imaging and pathology services provide support to clinical activities. Both laboratory facilities are separate from the hospital and are provided with a total of four BSL 3 and one cabinet BSL 4 laboratories.The Institute preparedness plan states that dedicated personnel should consult the above-mentioned Web sites daily for infectious disease news worldwide. An infection control team is active to provide support for the management of emergencies, when necessary.In case of admission of patients with suspected or documented highly contagious infectious diseases referred to our Institute from the airport, ports or other hospitals, a dedicated pathway with a separate entrance from daily hospital activities has been designed.The Institute is equipped with two high-containment ambulances for transportation of highly contagious patients, with a sealed negative pressure section for the patient area and HEPA filters for air exhausting. Two stretcher isolators (Vickers Medical Containment Stretcher Transit Isolatoră, Isolators Ltd., Shropshire, UK) are also available for transportation of patients with highly infectious diseases. The self-contained isolation system consists basically of a lightweight stretcher onto which is attached a demountable framework supporting a transparent plastic envelope. The plastic envelope has a negative pressure differential with respect to the atmosphere, which is maintained by an air supply system in order to avoid the exit of potentially contaminated air.Isolation procedures are implemented from the time of admission, where a triage area with a negative air pressure room is dedicated to patients presenting syndromes of a suspected airborne infection, and Respiratory Hygiene/ Cough Etiquette recommendations are already ongoing.At Spallanzani Institute, hospital isolation measures and universal precautions have been implemented since the mid-1980s, after the spread of HIV. The hospital infection control protocols, largely based on the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee guidelines on isolation precautions in hospitals (50) , have been further reinforced, strengthened and updated in the following years to deal with the re-emergence of tuberculosis and the management of SARS, anthrax, and VHF crisis (55, 56) . Disposable personnel protective equipment (PPE) consisting of masks or respirators, gloves, gowns, hair and shoe covers, and eye-wear are available. PPE recommended for the management of highly contagious patients are Tyvek tissue full-body suits with thermo-activated closure, full face mask with P3 filtered respirators, and latex obstetric gloves to be used in double gloving.Multiple educational and training sessions on adherence to infection control protocols have been developed for health care and laboratory personnel.Transport, collection and handling of samples follow biosafety level procedures, according to WHO (57) .In addition to routine microbiological tests (i.e., serological commercial and in-house assays, direct identification, and culture), several multi-diagnostic panels based on modern biomolecular technology have been developed, and electron microscopy is available (Table 1) .For example, respiratory clinical specimens can be timely analyzed by PCR or RT-PCR for the presence of different viruses (influenza A and B, metapneumovirus, adenoviruses, parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3, RSV, rhinovirus), including old and novel coronaviruses (coronaviruses OC43, 229E, NL63, New Haven and HKU1), as well as Chlamydia, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila (58) .\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nThe recent bioterrorist events and the worldwide outbreaks of highly contagious infectious diseases have evidenced the need for institutional preparedness at each hospital, for identification of referral centers for patient isolation and of laboratories with adequate capabilities. Moreover, hospitals should develop a plan for coordinating all hospital components to respond to critical situations deriving from the admission of patients with highly contagious infectious diseases. In our article, we reviewed the main components of hospital preparedness in the initial response to sporadic or clustered highly contagious diseases, and illustrated the model of the \"Spallanzani\" Institute for copying with the challenge posed by emerging and re-emerging agents.Reporting to public health authorities by hospital doctors, infection control professionals and lab personnel of unusual infectious diseases, either sporadic or unusual clustering of illness in hospitalized patients, may serve as an early alert for prompt public health action and management in case of an epidemic risk.Moreover, active surveillance and participation in sentinel hospital networks should be encouraged by public health authorities in order to strengthen the capability to promptly identify community and hospital-acquired epidemics.Additionally, healthcare settings represent the frontline for reducing the emergence and spread of infectious diseases through the application of strict infection control practices, patient and HCW education, and provision of preventive measures.Finally, in the near future the surge capacity that is a health care system\\'s ability to rapidly expand beyond normal services to meet the increased demand for qualified personnel, medical care, and public health in the event of largescale public health emergencies or disasters, should be strengthened. Therefore, a host of issues including education, communication, and institutional response require innovative solutions. For this purpose, innovative educational programs to create and maintain the readiness of an appropriately trained workforce are necessary in order to help HCWs change their focus from the traditional clinically oriented view of infectious disease treatment to a more integrated, problem solving, infection control management approach.\\n\\n',\n"," 'ARTICLE_SUBMITTED': 'Die Zukunft der Mobilität: E-Autos erobern die Straßen (mit Plagiatsausschnitt)\\nDer Verkehrssektor ist einer der größten CO2-Emittenten weltweit.

Baldwin et al. mapped ethics and dementia research by using keywords [24] . Tian et al. used Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) database to measure scientific output of the field of Geographic Information System (GIS) by using keywords [25] . Similar approaches have been made to map knowledge evolution in other fields, such as software engineering [26] , chemistry [27] , scientometrics [28] , neural network research [29, 30] , biological safety [31] , optomechatronics [32] , bioeletronics [33] , adverse drug reactions [34, 35] , biotechnology [36, 37] , environmental science [38] , condensed matter physics [39] , etc., and even this keyword-based analysis has been applied to investigation of a phenomenon or a more specific topic such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and tsunami [40, 41] , and Parkinson\\'s disease [42] .However, the above mentioned methodologies are all based on keyword analysis which provides less sense of knowledge accumulation over time or limited understanding on causal interpretation of human knowledge development. Therefore, citationbased analyses have been also widely investigated by researchers to avoid the above mentioned problem and facilitate bibliometric analysis on accumulated knowledge. For example, Kajikawa has utilized citation analysis on SCI papers together with clustering citation network actors to understand structural change of sustainable energy [43] , biomass and bio-fuels [44] and organic LED [45] .\\n\\nMapping patented technology by patent citation\\n\\nIt has long been a very critical part of human knowledge system that patent and scientific publications are two most significant ways of disclosing science and technology progress in the society. Former publications can be served as important references or bases for later publication, in this way human knowledge can be gradually accumulated to sustain and expand knowledge system. The important featuring characteristic of patent and scientific publication for knowledge accumulation is their citations showing which former literatures have been contributed to this paper/patent and providing the context of knowledge accumulation. A number of researches have noted that patent citations trace out technological building relationships among inventions [46, 47] . Also, citation has been widely used in bibliometric study to evaluate technology development, research performance, and even map knowledge evolution or technological trajectory. For instance, Acosta investigated the links between science and technology based on an analysis of scientific citations in patent documents to study in greater depth the relationship between science and technological development in the various regions of Spain [48] , Hall et al. suggested that of all patent related indicators, patent citation is a more adequate indicator to evaluate market value [49] , Stuart and Podolny used patent citations to measure firms\\' technological niches and niche shifts [50] .Otte and Rousseau studied citation network, utilized as a type of social interaction networks, by the use of social network analysis, and calculate network property to discover how information can be disseminated among actors [51] , and Liebowitz indicated the possibility of mapping knowledge flows and measuring relationships among actors in a network [52] . Accordingly, this study aims to use the alternative citation-based method to avoid the problem of lacking causal knowledge accumulation if only keywords are considered in the analysis, and reap reward from the well-assigned citations in structured patent documents for drawing an overview of how electrical conducting polymer nanocomposite technology is evolved. In summary, patent citation information allows the building of patent linkages which eventually lead to a patent citation network as a whole. The constructed patent citation network, with patents as network nodes (actors) and patent citation as network ties, allows quantitative analysis on patent citation network by calculating network properties, e.g. Degree Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and Closeness Centrality. In this sense, mechanism of knowledge flow or technology evolution mechanism, e.g. technology convergence, technology diffusion, etc., can be quantitatively analyzed.However, a lot of similar attempts have been made to obtain technology development contexts by patent citation analysis [43] [44] [45] 47] , the purpose of this study is not to use conventional method to investigate a new technology domain, but to extend from conventional patent citation network research to a more systematic process of patented technology evaluation together with converting 3-dimensional citation network to a 2-dimensional patent map which can be more easily interpreted by human eyes. The quantitative 2-dimensional map provides a quick way, which is much easier than complex equations or theories, for people to directly perceive technological change through human eyes.\\n\\nInitial patent sampling\\n\\nThis research selects nanocomposite material as research target to draw its patent citation network. Patents with \"nano\" and \"composite\" appeared in title or abstract of patents are retrieved from USPTO (Patent retrieval time: Jun. 11, 2008). The retrieved patents are carefully reviewed to remove those which are not closely related to nanocomposite material, and finally a total of 672 patents are remained as \"initial patent\" in this study.\\n\\nThe development of technology-function matrix\\n\\nThe obtained 672 patents are critically analyzed and classified into two dimensions: 1) technological dimension based on the matrix material disclosed in patents, i.e. Polymer, Clay, Ceramic, Metal, etc., and 2) functional dimension based on the function of invented techniques, i.e. Mechanical and dimensional stability, Permeability, Thermal stability, Flame retardancy, Chemical resistance, Surface appearance, Electrical conductivity, Optical and light emitting property, Cement/adhesivity, Magnetic property, etc. (Table 1 ). Validation is done by comparing the content of classified patents with multiple sources and through informal interviews with members of the expert panel. It is worth noted that one single patent may disclose more than one matrix material or more than one function, one patent thus can be categorized into more than one classification, so the total patent count in Table 1 is 824 instead of the original 672. The classification of \"other\" in both matrix and function in Table 1 are either some other materials or functions not considered in this study, or more than three matrices or functions are disclosed in one single patent trying to reduce the specificity of its disclosed matrix or function. The obtained technology-function matrix shown in Table 1 provides an overview, or a so-called \"patent map\", for the development of nanocomposite material. Subsequently, this research selects 69 patents with the technology of \"polymer\" matrix and function of \"electrical conductivity\" to meet the requirement of the research target set in this study.\\n\\nNetwork patent sampling\\n\\nAfter classification of technology and function, the 69 patents with polymer matrix and function of electrical conductivity are used as primary patents based on which their backward citation patents and forward citation patents are retrieved from USPTO database as the secondary patents which are upstream patents and downstream patents of the primary patents, respectively. By examining upstream and downstream patents, a technological context of what upstream patents contribute to primary patents and what downstream patents are contributed by primary patents can be understood and the underlying knowledge flows can thus be analyzed. In summary, this research uses 1) primary patents: the 69 patents with polymer matrix and function of electrical conductivity, and 2) secondary patents: 690 backward citation patents of the 69 primary patents and 716 forward citation patents of the 69 primary patents, as actors of the patent citation network to be drawn in this study. The total number of obtained patents is 1421 instead of 1475 (the sum of primary patents and secondary patents) after removal of duplicated count (some patents belong to both primary and secondary patents). The 1421 patents are defined as \"network patents\" and are therefore treated as network actors (node), along with the network ties built by patent citation linkages, a patent citation network for understanding the development context of electrical conducting polymer nanocomposite can be achieved.\\n\\nPatent citation network and network property calculation\\n\\nAfter construction of the patent citation network, network property is subsequently calculated. In social network theory, \"Centrality\" is a key network property to estimate how easy an actor retrieves or controls resources from the network. Freeman proposed three ways of measuring network centrality, Degree Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and Closeness Centrality [53] . The higher centrality indicates more associations with actors in a network. Brass and Burkhardt [54] pointed out the higher centrality of a person in a social network, the more power s/he possesses from the viewpoint of organizational behavior. This research also uses the three ways of measurement for obtaining centrality of patented technology in order to understand the importance, influence, diffusivity and convergency of a patented technology.\\n\\nDegree Centrality\\n\\nNetwork nodes (actor) which directly linked to a specific node are in the neighborhood of that specific node. The number of neighbors is defined as nodal degree, or degree of connection. Granovetter suggested nodal degree is proportional to probability of obtaining resource [55] . Nodal degree represents to what degree a node (actor) participates the network, this is a basic concept for measuring centrality.InDegree Centrality: the number of time that patent i is cited by other patents. The higher InDegree Centrality, the more times that patent i is cited, meaning the higher momentum of knowledge diffusion from patent i to other patents. OutDegree Centrality: the number of times that patent i cites other patents. The higher OutDegree Centrality, the more times that patent i cites other patents, meaning the higher momentum of knowledge convergence from other patents to patent i.\\n\\nBetweenness Centrality\\n\\nThe concept of betweenness is a measure of how often an actor is located on the shortest path (geodesic) between other actors in the network. Those actors located on the shortest path between other actors are playing roles of intermediary that help any two actors without direct contact reach each other indirectly. Actors with higher Betweenness Centrality are those located at the core of the network.g jik g jk g jk : the shortest path between patent (actor) j and patent k. g jik : the shortest path between patent j and patent k that contains patent i.\\n\\nCloseness Centrality\\n\\nThe Closeness Centrality of an actor is defined by the inverse of the average length of the shortest paths to/from all the other actors in the network. Higher Closeness Centrality indicates higher influence on other actors. In a directed network, Closeness Centrality can be divided into InClosenesss Centrality and OutCloseness Centrality.InCloseness Centrality: the shortest path from other patents to patent i, the higher InCloseness Centrality, the higher influence of patent i on other patents.OutCloseness Centrality: the shortest path from patent i to other patents, the higher OutCloseness Centrality, the easier for patent i to be influenced by other patents.:the shortest path from patent i to patent j.\\n\\nConcordance between network properties and technology evolution mechanisms\\n\\nThe previously mentioned network properties can be used as indicators for characterizing technology evolution context, and therefore quantitative analysis on the evolution context can be obtained. In this study, we propose the applications of the five network properties on evaluating evolution contexts for electrical conducting nanocomposite technology, namely the concordance between network properties and technology evolution mechanisms, which provides a quantitative approach toward evolution mechanism:(1) InDegree Centrality: the number of times that a patent is cited, it can be used as an indicator to measure knowledge flow from one target patent to later patents. Because of its implication of knowledge diffusion, InDegree Centrality is defined as an indicator to measure momentum of technology diffusion. (2) OutDegree Centrality: the number of times that a patent cites other patent(s), it can be used as an indicator to measure knowledge flow received by a target patent. Because of its implication of knowledge convergence, OutDegree Centrality is defined as an indicator to measure momentum of technology convergence. (3) Betweenness Centrality: how often an actor is located on the shortest path (geodesic) between other actors in the network.Therefore, Betweenness is defined as an indicator to measure momentum of technology transition. (4) InCloseness Centrality: the shortest path from other patent(s) to a target patent. The shorter path, the stronger the target patent influences other patent(s). InCloseness Centrality is therefore defined as an indicator to measure momentum of influence. (5) OutCloseness Centrality: the shortest path from a target patent to other patent(s). The shorter path, the stronger the target patent is influenced by other patent(s). OutCloseness Centrality is therefore defined as an indicator to measure momentum of being influenced.Even though the five network properties represents five mechanisms of technology evolution. Patents with higher centralities are those located closer to the core of a target research field, or they can be called the core patents. But the idea of \"core\" relies on which of the five above indicators is used.\\n\\nConstructing distance-based patent citation map\\n\\nIn this study, a patent citation map is obtained by calculating relative positions and density of network actors in a two-dimension map on the basis of network constructed previously. We use algorithm proposed by van Eck and Waltman\\'s in 2007 [35] . 1) Actor position: the positions of network actors in the map are based on visualization of similarities. If there are totally n actors, a two-dimensional map where the actor 1-n are positioned in a way that the distance between any pair of actor i and j reflects their association strengths a ij as accurately as possible, i.e. distance between i and j is proportional to a ij , van Eck and Waltman\\'s algorithm is used to minimize a weighted sum of the squared Euclidean distance between all pairs of actors, the objective function to be minimized is given as below:Where the vector x i = (x i1 ,x i2 ) denotes the location of actor i in a two-dimensional space and ||•|| denotes the Euclidean norm.2) Actor density: actor density at a specific location in a map has to be calculated. The actor density is calculated by first placing a kernel function at each actor location and taking a weighted average of the kernel function.The actor density at location x = (x 1 , x 2 ) is given byWhere K denotes a kernel function and h denotes a smoothing parameter. C ii denotes the number of occurrence of actor I and x = (x 1 , x 2 ) denotes the location of actor i in the map. The kernel function K is a non-increasing Gaussian kernel function given by\\n\\nResults and discussion\\n\\nThe selection of paper or patent used for discovering development trend will fundamentally lead to different results. The relation between paper and patent has long been subject to debate. However, instead of analyzing the interplay between paper and patent, this study aims to shed light on the use of patent as a technological system for understanding technological trends as well as propose a systematic and quantitative method for the patent-based mapping. \\n\\nInitial patent analysis\\n\\nAccording to the technology and function matrix shown in Table 1 , in terms of technology, most patents disclosed nanocomposite material with polymer matrix (503 patents) and subsequently ceramic matrix (138 patents). In terms of function, most patents are for Professional and scientific instruments 38 (except 3825)  197  3  Rubber and miscellaneous plastics products  30  122  4  Industrial inorganic chemistry  281  112  5  Miscellaneous chemical products  289  105  6 Paints, varnishes, lacquers, enamels, and allied products 285 95 7Plastics materials and synthetic resins 282 80 8Electrical industrial apparatus 362 62 9Industrial organic chemistry 286 41 10 Stone, clay, glass and concrete products 32 37 11 Textile mill products 22 36 12 Miscellaneous electrical machinery, equipment and supplies 369 33 13 Special industry machinery, except metal working 355 26 14 General industrial machinery and equipment 356 23 15 All other SICs 99 16 16 Electrical lighting and wiring equipment 364 15 17 Fabricated metal products 34 (except 3462, 3463, and 348) 14 18 Drugs and medicines 283 9 19 Primary and secondary non-ferrous metals 333-336, 339 (except 3399), and 3463 9 20Agricultural chemicals 287 8Data source: this study, (USPTO UPC to SIC concordance, 2008). mechanical and dimensional stability (285 patents), and then electrical conductivity (148 patents), and optical and light emitting property (121 patents). This research aims to study electrical conducting polymer nanocomposite, so the 69 patents with technology of \"polymer\" matrix and function of \"electrical conductivity\" are selected as primary patents for subsequent investigation.\\n\\nNetwork patent analysis\\n\\nFor all the obtained 1421 network patents, countries with the most patents are US (1129 patents), Japan (143 patents), Germany (32 patents), Korea (23 patents), and UK (18 patents) . This reveals that electrical conducting polymer nanocomposite related technologies are mainly located in the US, Japan, and Europe but US is much more significant than other countries (Fig. 1) .If 1421 network patents are classified by Standard Industrial Classification) (USPTO UPC to SIC concordance, 2008) [56] , as shown in Table 2 , there are 213 patents in no. 1 classification (electronic components and accessories and communications equipment), 197 patents in no. 2 classification (professional and scientific instruments), and 122 patents in no. 3 classification (rubber and miscellaneous plastics products). The sum of classification no. 1, 2 and 3 is more than one third of the total 1421 network patents. This implies the strong application of electrical conducting polymer nanocomposite on electric instrument, and the emerging nanotechnology combined with conventional nanocomposite material bring great influences on electronic components or scientific instrument.\\n\\nNetwork visualization\\n\\nThe patent citation network composed of 1421 patents and 1705 patent citation relationships are plotted by computer, shown in Figs. 2-4 for patents filed on different time period (note: patents which act as isolated node/actors without any networking are not shown in figures). Each node represents a patent and each network tie with arrow represents a citation relationship. The patents pointed by arrows of the network ties are cited by those located at the other end of the network ties. In Fig. 2 , patent citation network based on patents filed in the period 1952-1991 is plotted and only several patents are networked together and presented a simple radial structure. In Fig. 3 , more patents are networked for the period 1952-2000 but still several separated clusters can be observed. In Fig. 4 , networking is fully matured and almost all patents are networked together for the total time period 1952-2008 in this study.\\n\\nNetwork properties calculation\\n\\nAccording to aforementioned method of calculating network properties, network properties, i.e. Betweenness Centrality, InCloseness Centrality, OutCloseness Centrality, InDegree Centrality and OutDegree Centrality of each network node are calculated. Fig. 5 shows the average of Betweenness Centrality, OutDegree Centrality and InDegree Centrality for each year. Significant peaks around the period of 1984 and 1992, 1997-2001 indicate important time periods for development of related technology. After 1992, network becomes more mature. The similar peak positions for Between Centrality curve and InDegree Centrality curve suggests technology diffusion and technology transition are closely associated with each other.Network properties (InDegree Centrality, OutDegree Centrality, and Betweenness Centrality) for each country are also averaged to determine how significant a country contributes to the development of technology. As shown in Fig. 6 , US, Taiwan, and Korea are the three countries with the highest Betweenness Centralities. Antilles, Ireland, and US are the three countries with the top three InDegree Centralities, and Israel, Canada, and Korea are the three countries with the top three OutDegree Centralities. However, since each country possesses different number of patents, statistical bias for countries with limited number of patents is possible. Table 3 shows patents with top 10 network properties. These patents with top network properties are core patents or key technologies that are classified by aforementioned momentums of technology development, i.e. technology diffusion, technology convergence, influence, being influenced, and technology transition. Patents listed in Table 3 are completely filed by the US assignees. Endicott Interconnect Technologies, Zyvex Performance Materials, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co., and Hyperion Catalysis International are top companies that own most patents in Table 3 , indicating their important roles as core actors in this technology field.\\n\\n2-dimensional mapping\\n\\nThe patent citation map with country as actor is shown in Fig. 7 (Color gradient from blue to red indicates low to high actor density) where two separate domains reflecting distribution pattern of global techniques. The two domains dominated by the two countries with highest number of patents-the US and Japan. Where the US can be seen as the technology leader of countries of Belgium, Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, Austria, China, Netherlands Antilles, Australia, India, Switzerland, and Ireland. On the Fig. 6 . InDegree Centrality, Outdegree Centrality, Betweenness Centrality for each country. other hand, Japan can be regarded as technology leader of Great Britain, Israel, Korea, Mexico, Italy, France, Finland, and Taiwan. The US easily becomes the leading country of patented technologies due to its advantage of Sci-Tech resources and, of course, the large number of patents in very many aspects. But surprisingly, it is positive to see the clear boundary between the two domains led by different countries. This indicates positive technological diversification required for diverse ways of contribution to this society. The patent citation map with patent (shown as patent number) as actor in the map is shown in Fig. 8 . A total of 113 patents with InDegree equal to or larger than 2 are selected to construct the map where relative distance between any pair of actors and density of InDegree for each actor can be visualized. Fig. 8 shows patents uniformly occupy different spots of the map and form a big continent, unlike isolated islands in Fig. 7 , indicating well-distributed or highly concentrated patented techniques in this technology field.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nSocial network analysis on patent citation is demonstrated in this study to explore how patented technology development can be evolved from a patent citation network which visually represents the essential structure of technology evolution. Also, the linkages between the five different mechanisms of technology evolution and the five network properties, namely the concordance between technology evolution mechanisms and network properties, are defined and proposed in this study in order to provide a quantitative approach toward understanding technology evolution mechanisms for electrical conducting polymer nanocomposite technology. A patented technique plays multiple roles and shows different levels of importance in terms of the proposed five types of mechanism. The evolution mechanism represented by network property is a function of time in the overall technology development. Therefore, by calculating patents\\' network properties at different time points, a dynamic and quantitative understanding of technology evolution can be obtained.According to the large number of patents in top 3 SICs in Table 2 , it can be speculated that electrical conducting polymer nanocomposites are significantly applied on electric instrument, and the emerging nanotechnology combined with conventional nanocomposite material brings great influences on electronic components or scientific instrument.The similar peak positions for Between Centrality curve and InDegree Centrality curve in Fig. 5 suggest technology diffusion and technology transition are closely associated together. Table 3 shows top centrality patents in one type of network property are easily to be top centrality again in other type of network properties. This suggests each mechanism of technology evolution does not happen alone but is supposed to be more or less associated to other type of mechanisms. In other words, critical patents are likely to be important in several aspects of technology evolution mechanisms.It is found that 1984 and 1992, 1997-2001 are the important years for the development of electrical conducting polymer nanocomposite. US, Europe, Canada, Japan, Korea and Taiwan are major countries in this field. According to Standard Industry Classification, the largest portion of these patents is electronic components and scientific instruments. Endicott Interconnect Technologies, Zyvex Performance Materials, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co., and Hyperion Catalysis International are core companies in electrical conducting polymer nanocomposite industry.The length of a network tie in Figs. 2-4 is calculated for better visualization and has nothing to do with any network property. However, the length of a network tie can be proportional to similarity between two patents at both ends of a network tie, so it would be desirable to calculate similarity of two linked patents. For example, by calculating occurrence of same keyword in the two patents, and the obtained similarity can be used as the attribute of network tie. Text mining technique can possibly be applied on patents in each separated sub-domains in Figs. 2-4 to understand the differences among sub-domains, so deeper insight about how technology is evolved in each sub-domain can be employed in future study.The 2-dimensional patent citation maps with country or patent as actor are shown in Figs. 7 and 8. This allows a straightforward view of the whole development of selected technology, and provides a quick idea of how the global technology has been developed, or a so-called knowledge map for positioning every patented technique in the patent citation map. However, this study only demonstrates the construction of patent citation map by the use of overall patents without considering time horizon. A dynamic map is also possible if we plot the 2-dimensional patent citation map for every year so the development over time can be observed.In Summary, this study provides a way of patent evaluation and understanding technology development context in a systematic manner which facilitates more efficient technology management. Systematic methodologies involving citation analysis have been investigated in the field of technology forecast [57] [58] [59] , but this study focuses more on systematic patent analysis and 2-dimensional visualization on the basis of conventional methods, and then demonstrates a systematic and quantitative way for analyzing and evaluating patented techniques by integrating basic patent statistics, technology-function classification, standard industrial classification, patent citation, network properties calculation and two-dimensional mapping. All of these contribute to a systematic approach for obtaining an overview of large amount of selected patents, more importantly this paper provides a quantitative way of evaluating patent and thus a computerized calculation is possible for potential quantitative applications e.g. R&D resource allocation, research performance evaluation, patent valuation, 2-dimensinol patent map visualization etc.\\n\\n',\n"," 'ARTICLE_SUBMITTED': 'モビリティの未来：電気自動車が道を切り拓く \\n交通セクター (Kotsu Sekutā) は、世界で最も二酸化炭素 (Nisanka Tanso) を排出している分野の一つです。気候変動 (Kiko Hendō) と闘い、都市の生活の質 (Seikatsu no Shitsu) を向上させるためには、持続可能な交通革命 (Jizoku Kanōna Kōtsū Kakumei) が急務となっています。電気自動車 (Denki Jidōsha) は、この変革において中心的な役割を果たします。\\n\\n電気自動車の台頭 (Denki Jidōsha no Taitō)\\n\\n\\n電気自動車は、ガソリン車 (Gasorin Sha) に比べて以下のような利点を持ちます。\\n\\n環境に優しい : 電気自動車は走行中 (Sōkōchū) に排気ガス (Haiki Gasu) を排出しないため、都市の空気質 (Kūki no Shitsu) の改善に貢献します。\\n低い維持費 (Hikui Ijihi): 電気自動車は、1キロあたりの電気代 (Denki Dai) が、一般的にガソリンやディーゼル (Dīzeru) のコストをはるかに下回ります。\\n静粛性 (Seijukusei): 電気自動車はガソリン車よりもはるかに静かです。これは、都市における騒音被害 (Sōon Higai) の軽減に貢献します。\\n革新的な技術 (Kakushin-teki na Gijutsu): 電気自動車は、しばしばガソリン車よりも技術的に進歩しており、自動運転 (Jidō Untenshū) やコネクティビティ (Konekuttibiti) などの新機能を提供します。\\n電気自動車の課題 \\n電気自動車には多くの利点があるにもかかわらず、交通の完車の普及 (Fukyū) にとって重要な要素です。現時点では、公共の充電ステーション (Kōkyō no Jūden Sutēshon) の数はまだ不十分です。\\n。'}"]},"execution_count":184,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["jp_article_to_check = \"\"\"モビリティの未来：電気自動車が道を切り拓く\n","交通セクター (Kotsu Sekutā) は、世界で最も二酸化炭素 (Nisanka Tanso) を排出している分野の一つです。気候変動 (Kiko Hendō) と闘い、都市の生活の質 (Seikatsu no Shitsu) を向上させるためには、持続可能な交通革命 (Jizoku Kanōna Kōtsū Kakumei) が急務となっています。電気自動車 (Denki Jidōsha) は、この変革において中心的な役割を果たします。\n","\n","電気自動車の台頭 (Denki Jidōsha no Taitō)\n","\n","\n","電気自動車は、ガソリン車 (Gasorin Sha) に比べて以下のような利点を持ちます。\n","\n","環境に優しい : 電気自動車は走行中 (Sōkōchū) に排気ガス (Haiki Gasu) を排出しないため、都市の空気質 (Kūki no Shitsu) の改善に貢献します。\n","低い維持費 (Hikui Ijihi): 電気自動車は、1キロあたりの電気代 (Denki Dai) が、一般的にガソリンやディーゼル (Dīzeru) のコストをはるかに下回ります。\n","静粛性 (Seijukusei): 電気自動車はガソリン車よりもはるかに静かです。これは、都市における騒音被害 (Sōon Higai) の軽減に貢献します。\n","革新的な技術 (Kakushin-teki na Gijutsu): 電気自動車は、しばしばガソリン車よりも技術的に進歩しており、自動運転 (Jidō Untenshū) やコネクティビティ (Konekuttibiti) などの新機能を提供します。\n","電気自動車の課題\n","電気自動車には多くの利点があるにもかかわらず、交通の完車の普及 (Fukyū) にとって重要な要素です。現時点では、公共の充電ステーション (Kōkyō no Jūden Sutēshon) の数はまだ不十分です。\n","。\"\"\"\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","analysis_result = run_plagiarism_analysis(jp_article_to_check, vector_database, plagiarism_threshold=0.8)\n","analysis_result"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":185,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":32087,"status":"ok","timestamp":1714428545811,"user":{"displayName":"Manash Pratim Bhuyan","userId":"13561199873062079254"},"user_tz":-330},"id":"BP4JbtdM5c2g","outputId":"785c2857-9420-4ca6-91c4-36b2dfb93ec6"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/transformers/models/marian/tokenization_marian.py:175: UserWarning: Recommended: pip install sacremoses.\n","  warnings.warn(\"Recommended: pip install sacremoses.\")\n"]},{"data":{"text/plain":["{'Similarity_score': 0.7650006,\n"," 'is_Plagiarism': False,\n"," 'Most_similar_article': \"\\n\\nMany pathogenic viruses can remain viable on human hands for hours. 1, 2 This gives hands the potential to spread such infectious agents directly or indirectly [3] [4] [5] in settings such as hospitals. 6, 7 Recent studies with experimentally contaminated fingertips have further substantiated the potential of hands to spread viruses. 8, 9 These observations reemphasize the need for proper hand disinfection in the prevention and control of nosocomial outbreaks of viral infections in particular. However, hand disinfectants are often tested against vegetative bacteria only and this may not reflect on their ability to deal with viruses. 10 While alcohol-based hand rubs generally have a broader and relatively rapid antimicrobial activity, they are often limited in their ability to inactivate non-enveloped viruses. 7 Raising the ethanol content may address this issue to some degree, but increases the risk of tissue toxicity 11 and lowers the flash point. At present, only one formulation with broad virucidal activity exists with an ethanol content of 95 vol%. Therefore, efforts were made to reduce the ethanol content without reducing the virucidal activity to decrease the flash point and increase skin tolerance and compliance. As a result of these efforts, a synergistic combination was developed with an ethanol content of 55% (w/w) in combination with 10% (w/w) propan-1-ol, 5.9% (w/w) propan-1.2-diol, 5.7% (w/w) butan-1.3-diol and 0.7% phosphoric acid. 12 This ready-to-use formulation is registered by the US Food and Drug Administration (NDC-6673-1230-(I)- (9) ). Since introduction of the evaluated product in Austrian hospitals, no relevant unwanted side-effects have been reported to date.\\n\\nMaterials and methods Cells\\n\\nThe following cells were used: FL (amnion) cells (Stephan Angeloff Institute of Microbiology, Sofia, Bulgaria; ATCC No. CCL-62) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (GIBCO BRL, Paisley, Scotland, UK) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10 mmol/L HEPES buffer (VWR International GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) and antibiotics (penicillin, 100 U/mL, streptomycin, 100 mg/mL); BS-C-1 (Cercopithecus monkey kidney) cells ( 13 For poliovirus type 1, stock virus suspensions with an infectious titre !10 8 CCID 50 /mL were centrifuged at low speed and then at 70 000 g (L8, Beckman Instruments, Porterville Plants, CA, USA) for 30 min at C4 8C. The sediment was resuspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged again at low speed. The clarified supernatant contained a titre of at least 10 8 CCID 50 /mL.For fingerpad experiments, Sabin vaccine strain of poliovirus type 1 (LSc 2ab, ATCC VR-59, kindly provided by the Behringwerke AG, Liederbach, Germany) or the abovementioned strain F9 of FCV was used.\\n\\nVolunteers\\n\\nThree male and four female adults participated in fingerpad tests using poliovirus type 1 and FCV (strain F9). All volunteers had received oral polio vaccination, were seropositive by neutralization tests, and confirmed in writing their informed consent to participate in this study. The Ethics Committee of Central Hospital St-Jürgen-Str (Bremen, Germany) gave permission for this clinical study (No. 50-09-97). Before each test, the hands of the volunteers were carefully inspected to preclude dermatoses, open wounds or other skin disorders.\\n\\nHand disinfectants and chemicals\\n\\nFor assessing the influence of ethanol content on efficacy against poliovirus type 1, three commercial hand disinfectants were tested in diluted and undiluted forms. Product A contained only 75% (w/w) ethanol with no other active ingredients. Product B contained 80% (w/w) ethanol in combination with 0.5% non-ionic detergent. Product C contained 80% (w/w) ethanol in combination with 0.1% benzalkonium chloride, 0.025% 2-phenylphenol and 0.025% clorophen.For developing the new formulation (hereafter called the test product), various different chemicals (Table I) were screened in combination with an ethanol concentration of 55% (w/w). The chemicals were purchased from VWR International GmbH. The final formulation, a ready-to-use preparation, contained 55% (w/w) ethanol, 10% (w/w) propan-1-ol, 5.9% (w/w) propan-1.2-diol, 5.7% (w/w) butan-1.3-diol and 0.7% phosphoric acid. For testing the undiluted solution using the quantitative suspension assay, 14 a formulation with 1.2! the regular concentration of the active ingredients was produced (resulting in a concentration of 96% of the test product). To test vaccinia-virus-and FCVinactivating properties, a formulation of 1.25! was used (resulting in 100% of the test product). For some in vitro experiments, the formulation to be tested was diluted with double-distilled water.In fingerpad tests with poliovirus, the test product (100%) and the reference standard [60% (v/v) propan-2-ol] were used as recommended in EN 1500. 15 For testing FCV, 70% (v/v) ethanol and 70% (v/v) propan-1-ol were included as references.\\n\\nQuantitative suspension test with viruses\\n\\nThe guideline of the German Federal Health Office (Robert Koch-Institut, Berlin, Germany) and the DVV for testing the effectiveness of chemical disinfectants against viruses 14 was strictly followed. Briefly, virus suspension, 2% serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), FCS, doubledistilled water and the hand disinfectant or the hand disinfectant dilutions were brought to 20 8C. One part of the virus suspension was mixed with either one part of double-distilled water, one part of the 2% serum albumin solution or one part of FCS. No protein load was added in the experiments with rotavirus, since FCS has rotavirus-inhibitory and trypsin-neutralizing activity. Then, eight parts of the formulation were added to each preparation. The mixtures were kept at 20 8C (in a water bath) for the exposure period. At the end of the exposure period, 10-fold serial dilutions of the control and test samples were prepared immediately in ice-cold culture medium (0.5 mL sample C4.5 mL medium), inoculated into respective host cells in suspension, placed in 96-well microtitre plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA), and incubated at 37 8C. Six or eight wells per sample dilution were inoculated. Virus control preparations contained identical protein concentrations. The cytopathic effect was recorded microscopically, and infectious virus titre in CCID 50 was evaluated by the endpoint dilution method of Reed and Muench. 16 The log 10 of the reduction factor, hereafter called the reduction factor (RF), was determined by subtracting the logarithmic titre CCID 50 at any test point from the logarithmic titre CCID 50 of the virus control. The 95% confidence limits of the reduction factors were obtained according to the EMEA guideline. 17 In this quantitative suspension test, a disinfectant solution was considered to have virucidal efficacy if, within the tested exposure period, the titre was reduced at least 10 4 -fold (RFZ4, inactivation 99.99%). This does not mean that an RF of 4 is regarded as sufficient for practical purposes. However, in general, the virucidal efficacy can not be followed over a titre range of more than 10 4 -fold due to the cytotoxicity of the substances tested. In fingerpad methods, the efficacy of a hand disinfectant has to be considered by comparison with a selected reference.An indirect immunofluorescence test was used for detection of HAV. Contact sample dilutions inoculated in BS-C-1 cells were incubated in 96-and 24well plates at 37 8C. After three weeks, cell sheets were scraped by a rubber policeman and transferred to standard microscope slides. The smears were dried at 20 8C and fixed by cold acetone for 15 min. They were then treated for 30 min at 37 8C in a humid atmosphere with 1:10 anti-HAV human hyperimmune serum (titre in Abbott enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 1:400 anti-HAV immunoglobulin G, and 1:40 in indirect immunofluorescence test vs HAV, HM 175/18 f strain, in BS-C-1 cells), twice rinsed for 5 min with PBS and once for 5 min with distilled water. Samples were dried at 37 8C and treated for 30 min at 37 8C (placed in a humid atmosphere) with a 1:8 dilution of anti-human fluorescein isothiocyanate labelled goat serum (National Centre of Infectious and Parasitic Diseases) supplemented with a contrast solution of Evans' blue (VWR International GmbH) (final solution of 1:80 000). Samples were again rinsed twice with PBS for 5 min, washed with distilled water, dried at 37 8C, and observed under a fluorescence microscope. Virus titre was calculated according to Reed and Muench. 16 In addition, a control for cytotoxicity was included in parallel with virucidal testing. Eight parts of the hand disinfectants were mixed with two parts of Dulbecco's PBS; serial dilutions were prepared and added to the respective host cell suspension. The effect of compound tested on cellular morphology was traced for overt signs of cytotoxicity until the end of the period of infectious virus assay recording.All reported data are mean values from three repeated experiments, carried out simultaneously. For CCID 50 evaluation according to the routine Reed and Muench method, 16 a Dlog 10 RF value of 1.7 (as compared to untreated controls) is considered to be statistically significant (the minimum effective concentration), and a Dlog 10 RF value of 1.6-1.0 is considered to be borderline. Depending on test conditions, the threshold for demonstrating virucidal efficacy against HBV is a reduction of R10 3 -fold. 13 \\n\\nFingerpad method\\n\\nThe study was performed for poliovirus type 1 according to ASTM standard E-1838-96 18 and for FCV according to ASTM standard E-1838-02. 19 Briefly, 10 mL of virus suspension was placed on a demarcated area on each fingerpad and the inoculum was allowed to dry. The dried inoculum was then exposed to 1 mL of the reference [70% (v/v) ethanol, 70% (v/v) propan-1-ol and 60% (v/v) propan-2-ol] or standard hard water (SHW) or test formulation contained in a glass vial (Serolab, Aidenbach, Germany). The contact time was either 30 or 60 s. For poliovirus testing, tests without soil load were performed, whereas for FCV, a tripartite soil load according to E-1838-02 with bovine serum albumin, mucin and tryptone was included. Virus remaining on fingerpads was eluted with 1 mL Earle's balanced salt solution containing 1% tryptone (FCV without tryptone). Afterwards, virus titre in the eluate was determined directly by endpoint titration (poliovirus titration with GMK-AH 1 cells, FCV titration with KE-R cells) in microtitre plates. The calculation of virus titre for the fingerpad method was performed by the methods of Spearman 20 and Kärber. 21 Three controls were included to determine: (1) the amount of infectious virus in the inoculum; (2) the infectious virus placed on the two thumbpads without drying; and (3) the infectious virus remaining on fingerpads after drying of the inoculum. The difference in infectious virus in the inoculum control and the dried virus control represents the loss in virus infectivity due to drying of the inoculum. The amount of infectious virus remaining after drying of the inoculum was used as the baseline to determine the extent of virus elimination after treatment with test product or references. We used four randomly selected fingerpads for treatment with test product and two for treatment with references.\\n\\nScreening with various ethanol-based combinations for selection of the new formulation\\n\\nAn ethanol concentration below 80% alone (Product A) as well as in combination with detergent (Product B) or with phenolics and quaternary ammonium compounds (Product C) was not sufficiently effective (RF!4) against poliovirus within 1 min (Table II) . Therefore, combinations with longer-chain alcohols were tested. The selected basic formulation, ethanol 55% (w/w) C0.7% phosphoric acid, was most effective in combination with propan-1.2-diol and butan-1.3-diol (Table I) .Due to the replacement of propan-1.2-diol by acetone, a lower efficacy was measured. Addition of a mineral acid was important for efficacy, whereas there was no difference between the influences of phosphoric acid and HCl (Table III) . In previous tests, the formulation with lactic acid was not stable for more than three months (data not shown). The content of 10% (w/w) propan-1-ol is essential to get the defined in vivo efficacy for surgical disinfection (data not shown).\\n\\nVirucidal efficacy of the test product in vitro against a wide variety of viruses\\n\\nAs expected, influenza viruses A and B, HSV types 1 and 2, RSV, vaccinia virus, HRV and BVDV (surrogate of hepatitis C virus) proved to be quite sensitive to the action of the formulation tested, and these viruses were inactivated within 30 s even in the presence of protein load (Table IV) . No replication of BCV (surrogate of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus, SARS-CoV) could be determined after 30 s. The test product (even 80%) was able to inactivate FCV (surrogate of norovirus) after a contact time of 30 s, even in the presence of protein load. HAV was inactivated by the test product with 96% use concentration within 30 s, but poliovirus was only inactivated after 1 min. HBV was also inactivated within 30 s with an RFZ3.4. SV 40 was clearly more resistant; 3 min was needed to inactivate the virus in the presence of protein load and 1 min without protein. Adenovirus strain type 2 was the most resistant test virus, resulting in efficacy of the hand disinfectant without protein load within 2 min and with protein addition within 3 min.\\n\\nVirucidal activity of the test product on fingerpads\\n\\nAfter 30 s, the test product was significantly more effective (RFZ3.04) against poliovirus in the fingerpad test than 60% (v/v) propan-2-ol. After 60 s, the RF was 3.13 (Table V) . In comparison, the values with the reference solution were only 1.32 and 1.23, respectively (significance level for both exposure times PZ0.001).Results with FCV are shown in Table VI \\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nIn the present study, the virucidal activity of this formulation against poliovirus was evaluated during development in comparison with three other alcohol-based hand disinfectants. Furthermore, a broad spectrum of human pathogenic viruses causing nosocomial infections or their surrogates was included later in the study design.In the quantitative suspension test without and with protein load, all tested enveloped viruses were inactivated after an exposure time of 30 s, resulting in an RF of 4.The test product was also able to inactivate the more resistant non-enveloped viruses. Ethanol 55% (w/w) in combination with long-chain alcohols reached a high virucidal efficacy against poliovirus after an exposure time of 1 min. In another study, only 90% ethanol was able to inactivate echovirus 11, which has a comparable tenacity as echovirus 11 and poliovirus both belong to the enteroviruses. 22 Lower concentrations of ethanol failed to inactivate echovirus 11 after an exposure time of 1 min. Additionally, another product with a high ethanol content of 80% in combination with 0.2% peracetic acid displayed poliovirus-inactivating properties. 23 The most remarkable effect of the test product was demonstrated when testing HAV. Against HAV, inactivation was found after an exposure time of 30 s. In another study, an alcohol mixture with a high content of ethanol (80% ethanol and 5% isopropanol) was not able to reduce the virus titre by an RF of 4 (RFZ2.2 after 1 min). 24 Furthermore, two other products with a high concentration of ethanol were not effective against HAV. 25 Without addition of protein, the RFs were 1.8 (disinfectant 1) and 3.2 (disinfectant 2) after an exposure time of 2 min. In the past, the fingerpad test method according to E-1838-96 has been shown to produce results comparable with the whole-hand model. 26 In tests of a commercially available product based upon ethanol (73.5% m/m) and propan-2-ol (10% m/m) against poliovirus type 1 strain Sabin, similar RFs were found in both test systems (fingerpad test 2.26, whole-hand model 2.38). Therefore, this comparison demonstrates that the fingerpad method is valuable for establishing recommendations for use of hand disinfectants.In the fingerpad test with poliovirus and an exposure time of 1 min, the low percentage ethanol formulation (55% v/v) in combination with long-chain alcohols was considerably more effective (RFZ3.13) than the reference 60% (v/v) propan-2-ol and 80% (v/v) ethanol. With FCV as a surrogate of norovirus, a virus reduction was measured showing that the test product was more effective than 70% ethanol and propan-1-ol. The RF of the test product was 2.38 with a tripartite soil load after 30 s. Interestingly, both alcohols at a concentration of 70% v/v have been described previously as having the highest virucidal activity against FCV in tests under practical conditions in comparison with 90% concentrations. 27 In contrast, testing two commercial available products based on 95% ethanol and 78.2% ethanol with a 5% faecal suspension as an organic load, the product with a higher alcohol concentration was significantly more effective than the formulation with the lower content. 28 The RFs were 2.17 and 1.07, respectively.The data derived from quantitative suspension assays and fingerpad tests demonstrate that as well as the other advantages, the test product fills a clinically relevant gap of virucidal hand disinfectants, demonstrating efficient, safe and fast-acting inactivation of many human pathogenic viruses and their surrogates causing nosocomial infections. \\n\\n\",\n"," 'ARTICLE_SUBMITTED': '新型コロナウイルス感染症(COVID-19)のパンデミックは、世界中で甚大な影響をもたらしました。このウイルスは2019年末に中国の武漢で初めて確認され、瞬く間に世界中に広まりました。発熱、咳、呼吸困難などが主な症状ですが、一部の患者では胃腸炎症状も見られます。重症化すると急性呼吸窮迫症候群を引き起こし、命にかかわる恐れがあります。\\nCOVID-19はヒトからヒトへと感染が広がります。主な感染経路は飛沫や接触によるものですが、一定の条件下では空気感染する可能性も指摘されています。無症状の感染者からも感染リスクがあり、密閉・密集場所での集団感染が多発しました。\\nパンデミック抑制のため、各国で外出制限、施設休業、渡航規制など、かつてない規模の対策がとられました。しかし、これらの措置は経済に大打撃を与え、感染収束と経済活動の両立が大きな課題となっています。\\nワクチン接種が進む一方で、ウイルスの変異による感染力増大や、ワクチン効果低下が危惧されています。治療薬の開発も進行中ですが、決定打にはなっていません。マスク着用、手洗い、換気などの基本的予防策の徹底が重視されています。\\nこの未曾有のパンデミックは、医療のみならず、社会経済、教育などあらゆる分野に深刻な影響を及ぼしています。今後、新たな変異株の発生や、季節的な感染の波が生じる可能性にも注意が必要です。ウィズコロナの時代を乗り越えるには、科学的知見に基づく適切な対策と、国民の理解が不可欠となるでしょう。'}"]},"execution_count":185,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["jp_article_to_check = \"\"\"新型コロナウイルス感染症(COVID-19)のパンデミックは、世界中で甚大な影響をもたらしました。このウイルスは2019年末に中国の武漢で初めて確認され、瞬く間に世界中に広まりました。発熱、咳、呼吸困難などが主な症状ですが、一部の患者では胃腸炎症状も見られます。重症化すると急性呼吸窮迫症候群を引き起こし、命にかかわる恐れがあります。\n","COVID-19はヒトからヒトへと感染が広がります。主な感染経路は飛沫や接触によるものですが、一定の条件下では空気感染する可能性も指摘されています。無症状の感染者からも感染リスクがあり、密閉・密集場所での集団感染が多発しました。\n","パンデミック抑制のため、各国で外出制限、施設休業、渡航規制など、かつてない規模の対策がとられました。しかし、これらの措置は経済に大打撃を与え、感染収束と経済活動の両立が大きな課題となっています。\n","ワクチン接種が進む一方で、ウイルスの変異による感染力増大や、ワクチン効果低下が危惧されています。治療薬の開発も進行中ですが、決定打にはなっていません。マスク着用、手洗い、換気などの基本的予防策の徹底が重視されています。\n","この未曾有のパンデミックは、医療のみならず、社会経済、教育などあらゆる分野に深刻な影響を及ぼしています。今後、新たな変異株の発生や、季節的な感染の波が生じる可能性にも注意が必要です。ウィズコロナの時代を乗り越えるには、科学的知見に基づく適切な対策と、国民の理解が不可欠となるでしょう。\"\"\"\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","analysis_result = run_plagiarism_analysis(jp_article_to_check, vector_database, plagiarism_threshold=0.8)\n","analysis_result"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"},"widgets":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-state+json":{}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
