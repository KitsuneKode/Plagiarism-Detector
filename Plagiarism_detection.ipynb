Participants included academic and industry researchers, funders, civil society organizations, implementers of global health interventions, and stakeholders from developing countries with adult immunization needs. These experts reviewed vaccine performance in older adults, the anticipated impact of adult vaccination programs, and the challenges and opportunities of building or strengthening an adult and older adult immunization platforms. Key conclusions of the meeting were that there is a need for discussion of new opportunities for vaccination of all adults as well as for vaccination of older adults, as reflected in the recent shift by WHO to a life-course approach to immunization; that immunization in adults should be viewed in the context of a much broader model based on an individual's abilities rather than chronological age; and that immunization beyond infancy is a global priority that can be successfully integrated with other interventions to promote healthy ageing. As WHO is looking ahead to a global Decade of Healthy Ageing starting in 2020, it will seek to define a roadmap for interdisciplinary collaborations to integrate immunization with improving access to preventive and other healthcare interventions for adults worldwide.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"INTRODUCTION\\n\\nIt is well documented that infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) produces a nephritis in chickens in natural outbreaks of disease (Winterfield and Hitchner, 1962; Cumming, 1963; Julian and Willis, 1969) . Many factors such as cold stress, nutrition, and age and sex of the chicken influence the mortality in an outbreak (Cumming, 1965; Sinkovic and Gilchrist, 1967; Macdonald, Randall and McMartin, 1980) . Those strains of virus which induce more severe kidney disease are also associated with higher mortality rates (Siller and Cumming, 1974; Chong and Apostolov, 1982) .In a study of the chemical pathology of infectious bronchitis nephritis, Heath (1970) attributed death of the chicken to kidney dysfunction and acute renal failure. Several histological investigations of the development of kidney lesions through the course of experimental infections have shown interstitial inflammatory reactions and tubular degeneration occurring in both proximal and distal segments of the nephron (Siller and Cumming, 1974; Pohl, 1974; Purcell, Tham and Surman, 1976) . Chong and Apostolov ( 1982) ) by immuno-fluoresence, demonstrated the presence of viral antigen in all segments of tubules, but the staining was mainly confined to the proximal tubules. These workers incriminated the replication of the virus in the tubular epithelium as a direct cause of the disease. This paper presents a quantitative morphological analysis of the changes in structure of the proximal tubular epithelial cells over the course of an experimental infection with IBV. MATERIALS AND METHODS\\n\\nExperimental Birds\\n\\nSixteen 3-week-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) Webster-Mini crossbred chickens were supplied by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Animal Health Division. Regular monitoring and serological testing have shown the birds from this isolation unit to be free from a wide range of mycoplasma, bacteria and viruses. The \\\"T\\\" strain of IBV (Winterfield, Cumming and Hitchner, 1964) was obtained from Dr T. Faragher, National Biological Standards Laboratory, Parkville, Victoria. The virus was passaged once in embryonated (SPF) eggs and the allantoic fluid, harvested at day 12, was stored in 1 ml aliquots at -70 \\\"C. In subsequent egg inoculation studies' the titre of IBV was found to be 3 x lo4 EID,, per ml.\\n\\nPlan of Experiment\\n\\nBirds were placed in a controlled temperature room at 12 \\\"C to induce cold stress. After 3 days, 4 control birds were anaesthetized and the left kidney was perfused with fixative via the renal portal vein. The remaining birds were inoculated with 10 ~1 of the viral suspension into both conjunctival sacs. At 4 day intervals thereafter, kidneys were fixed from groups of 4 birds.\\n\\nTissue Processing\\n\\nKidneys were perfused for at least 3 min under 90 cm hydrostatic pressure with a fixative consisting of 1.5 per cent glutaraldehyde, 1 per cent formaldehyde and 1.2 per cent glucose in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. Osmotic pressure of the buffer and glucose was 265 mOs per kg and the fixative was 540 mOs per kg. The pH was 7.4. The renal vein was sectioned and the portal valve was clamped. Acceptable perfusion was indicated if the kidney became pale and turgid. The kidney was then immediately removed from the bird, cut into 1 mm slices and placed in the same fixative for 1 h at 0 \\\"C. Tissue was washed in buffer 3 times and post-fixed in 1 per cent osmium tetroxide for 1 h, block stained with 2 per cent aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 h, dehydrated and embedded in Spurr's firm resin (Spurr, 1969) . Specimens for sectioning were selected at random and the criteria for adequate fixation were that the lumens of the proximal tubules were open, the microvilli were regularly arranged and the apical border of the cell was straight, with no protrusion into the lumen (Maunsbach, 1966a) . Silver sections 60 to 90 nm thick, from 3 blocks per bird, were collected on grids and stained with 0.3 per cent lead citrate for 3 min.For scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 1' s ices of fixed tissue were processed by the OTO method (Kelley, Dekker and Bluemink, 1975) and dried by the critical point method in CO,. The specimens were fractured, mounted on aluminium stubs and coated with 20 nm of gold.\\n\\nElectron Microscopy\\n\\nTransmission electron micrographs were taken of cells in longitudinal section (extending from the basement membrane to the lumen) from 6 different proximal tubules per section with a JEOL JEM-120.A magnification of 3600 was used for investigation of whole cells and 25 000 for detailed investigation of microvilli and organelles in the apical and basal parts of the cell. The magnification of the microscope was confirmed with a 1200 lines per mm diffraction grating replica. A JEOL JSM-T20 was used at 5 kV to take scanning electron micrographs.\\n\\nMicrographs\\n\\nwere printed with a further magnification of 3.6 and analysed with a microcomputer with a graphics tablet and an image analysis programme*. Data were collected from the digitizing tablet by tracing the outline of individual structures with a cursor for whole cell, nucleus, microvillus and extracellular space at low magnification level. At the high magnification, the following structures were analysed within a reference area overlay arbitrarily placed over the micrographs; microvillus membrane, apical tubular membrane, apical vacuoles, lysosomes, apical and basal mitochondria cristal and inner mitochondria membrane, lipid droplets and basolateral membrane. Stereological characteristics were calculated from standard formulae (Weibel, 1963; Williams, 1977) . Formfactor is the ratio, 48 x area divided by (perimeter)* which gives an estimate of shape of structures. This ratio is I.0 for a perfect circle. Nucleus profile diameter was calculated by taking the square root of the product of the diameters measured at right angles. By assuming that the nucleus was spherical, Fullman's formula (Williams, 1977 was applied to determine the mean nucleus diameter. The absolute volumes of the cell and cell components were then extrapolated from the nucleus volume and the relative volume densities.The sample size required to achieve results with confidence limits of & 10 per cent was determined from a study of normal chicken kidney (Condron, unpublished data). All values used in this investigation were measured from a large number of micrographs from 3 chickens. Progressive means were determined by including each additional observation.As a range of f 10 per cent of the final overall mean is considered adequate accuracy in biological studies, the sample size, or number of observations, needed to bring the progressive mean constantly into this range is the minimal sample required to obtain a valid estimate of a particular measurement (Burri, Giger, Gnagi and Weibel, 1968; WeibeI and Gnagi, 1968; Schroeder and Munzel-Pedrazzoli, 1970; Williams, 1977) . To increase the significance of the results the minimal sample size was exceeded with an extra animal in experimental groups, as this type of sampling has greater statistical weight than increasing the number of micrographs examined from a smaller group. The systematic subsampling employed has been shown to be a valid method of obtaining a representative unbiased measurement for morphometric analysis of a polarized tissue (Burri et al., 1968; Schroeder and Munzel-Pedrazzoli, 1970) . In order to determine the trend of the results through the course of the disease, statistical analysis for linear and quadratic regression against time was performed by applying the t-test to orthogonal polynomials (Hicks, 1973) . A further statistical comparison between groups was by the one-way analysis of variance.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nAll birds exhibited typical signs of infectious bronchitis. From day 3 onwards, the birds had ruffled feathers and were depressed.These signs were most severe between days 7 to 10 and some birds passed very fluid droppings. At day 8, the kidneys were swollen and pale, and urates were observed in the ureters. The disease produced was \\\"mild\\\" in character (Siller and Cumming, 1974) and no natural deaths occurred. Examination by light microscopy revealed a predominantly mononuclear inflammatory response.Quantitative morphological data for cellular components at the low magnification are given in Tables 1 to 3. Volume densities of the nucleus, microvillus and extracellular space relative to the total cell volume are given in Table 1 . Compared with the normal \\\"control\\\" group, the nucleus volume density tended to be reduced but this was not significant. The microvillus volume density was reduced at days 4, 8 and 12 and showed a linear regression; the extracellular space volume density was reduced at days 4 and 8 and returned to normal at day 12 with a quadratic regression. The values calculated for the absolute volume of these structures, shown in Table 2 , followed this same pattern. The reduction of microvillus volume was due to shortening and focal loss of microvilli. Estimators of cell and nucleus shapes are listed in Table 3 . There was an increase in cell formfactor at day 4 and an increase in cell maximal diameter at day 8, indicating that initially the cells became rounder and then decreased in size and became more elongated, returning to normal dimensions at day 12. The nuclear diameter remained relatively constant but there was an increase in formfactor at day 8. This rounding-up of the nucleus occurred later than similar changes in the cell.The surface density or surface area per unit volume of membrane structures is presented in Table 4 . There was a marked reduction in apical tubular membrane at day 4. This returned to normal at day 8, giving a significant quadratic regression against the shorter time interval. The relative density of microvillus membrane remained constant but the surface density per cell was reduced as the microvillus volume density decreased. Similarly, the slight increase in relative density of the basolateral membrane was overshadowed by a decrease in extracellular space, so that there was an overall decrease in the absolute surface areas of transport membranes per cell. Table 5 lists the volume densities of cytoplasmic components.After an initial reduction, there was an increase in apical vacuoles at day 8 and a progressive increase in lysosomes in the apical cytoplasm over the course of the experiment. However, these values were not significant in the statistical tests applied due to large variations between animals. A large increase in lipid droplets was observed in the base of the cells at day 4 but they were normal by day 8.There was a marked change in the distribution and shape of mitochondria. In the apical cytoplasm, there was an increase of mitochondria volume density at day 4, a decrease at day 8 and normal values at day 12. In the base of the cell, there was a decrease in mitochondria volume density which was most severe at day 8. These changes in volume density reflect changes in size and shape of individual mitochondrial profiles observed (Table 6 ). In the apical cytoplasm, with increase in volume density at day 4, the mitochondria had larger profiles which were longer and had more distorted or less rounded shapes. The subsequent decrease in volume density was accompanied by shorter, more rounded and smaller profiles towards day 12. In the basal cytoplasm, the decrease in volume density was mirrored by a decrease in size of individual profiles. The mitochondria became shorter and rounder towards day 12. The measurements related to shape were the same for apical and basal profiles at day 12. The inner mitochondrial membrane plus the cristal membrane had constant surface density per unit volume of mitochondria, but since there was a decrease in mitochondrial volume density there was a related decrease in mitochondrial membrane per cell. Figure 1 shows a typical epithelial cell from a normal chicken taken at low magnification.At day 4 (Fig. 2) , the cells tended to be more rounded. There was a decrease in apical tubular membrane and an increase in apical mitochondrial volume density. Lipid droplets were prominent at the base of the cell. Virus particles could be found in cells at day 4 (Fig. 3) . They were enclosed within irregular spaces adjacent to the nucleus by a membrane from which virus particles were budding. Figure 4 shows an epithelial cell at day 8 with focal loss of microvilli. There was also a reduction in apical mitochondria. At day 12 (Figs 7 and 8 ), mitochondria were dark and cristae were dilated. Figure 7 shows a cell with marked loss of microvilli. Vesicular spaces were prominent between cells (Fig,  8) . These spaces or \\\"holes\\\" in the cells were obvious in scanning electron micrographs (Figs 9 and IO) . Cytoplasmic inclusions into nuclei were observed at days 4,8 and 12 (Fig. 5) . Figure 6 shows a leucocyte migrating through the basement membrane and between two epithelial cells. This was common at days 8 and 12. Figures 11 and  12 show the basal part of the cell at the high magnification from a normal chicken and from a chicken at 12 days after infection, respectively.At 12 days, the mitochondria were smaller and more rounded, the mitochondrial matrix was condensed and the cristae were dilated. The endoplasmic reticulum was dilated.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nAlthough the disease reproduced in this study was mild, viral replication and kidney disease were observed and the chickens were obviously sick and depressed. The size of the infective dose, route of administration and increased egg passage are factors which are potential causes of the decreased virulence of this \\\"T\\\" strain of IBV compared to that reported by Siller and Cumming (1974) .Throughout the course of the disease, significant alterations in the structure of the functional components within the proximal tubular epithelium were observed.In particular, there was a decrease in the volume density of mitochondria and in the surface area of membrane structures. Both the microvillus membrane adjacent to the tubular lumen and the basolateral membrane adjacent to the extracellular space, which are separated by tight junctions at the apex of the cell, were reduced. The membrane available for transport of fluid and ions across the ceil was thus decreased. Within the cell, there was also a reduction in apical tubular membrane which is associated with uptake of larger molecules (Siller, 197 1) . Further evidence for change in water and ion transport is the dilated endoplasmic reticulum and the alteration in mitochondrial size and shape. The severity and degree of the changes observed correspond to stages 2 and 3 described by Trump, Croker and Mergner (1971) in their review of the pathogenesis of cell injury. These stages are compatible with cell survival but indicate a modification of cell membrane function and/or a modification of cell energy metabolism.There is a very close relationship between structure and function in membranes (Trump et al., 1971) . In studies of acute renal failure induced by ischaemia in rats, it has been shown that cells with these changes have ineffective ion and volume regulation.Glaumann, Glaumann, Berezesky and Trump ( 1975) concluded that, at this stage, sodium reabsorption by the proximal tubule must be greatly impaired.Similar alterations in the structure of cells have also been described in animals infected by coronaviruses other than IBV (Cheville, 1975; Takeuchi, Binn, Jervis, Keenan, Hildebrandt, Valas and Bland, 1976) . Measurements in short-circulated jejunal epithelia of piglets infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus have demonstrated abnormal glucose-stimulated sodium transport (Kerzner, Kelly, Gall, Butler and Hamilton, 1977) . These workers associated this impaired function with the presence of abnormal, immature villous epithelial cells which have migrated to the villi in a relatively undifferentiated state.Although there have been many recent advances in the determination of the replication strategy of coronaviruses, the mechanism of viral release has still not been clearly defined (Robb and Bond, 1979; Siddell, Wege and ter Meulen, 1982) . Evidence for cell lysis as the means of viral release has frequently been presented from studies in which the tissues have not received optimal preservation. Adequate preservation of tissue is essential to minimize fixation artefacts. Lysis and rupture of cells was not a feature of this study in which tissues were perfused with a carefully monitored fixative. Immersion fixation is unsuitable since rapid collapse of the tissue causes damage to the tubular epithelium including protrusion of the apical cytoplasm into the lumen and disruption of the microvillus border of the cells (Maunsbach, 1966a; Rothwell, 1974 Chong and Apostolov (1982) , who used immersion fixation, concluded that lysis of cells was the primary cause of nephritis induced by IBV but the type of lysis of cells which they observed may be readily produced by inadequate fixation. Doughri, Storz, Hajer and Fernando (1976) , Chasey and Alexander (1976) and Bielefeldt-Ohmann and Bloch (1982) h ave presented evidence that release of coronavirus may occur by fusion of viral-containing cytoplasmic vacuoles with the plasma membrane.Vesicular, hole-like structures in the lateral surfaces of cells which were observed by SEM are possibly the site of viral release by this mechanism of exocytosis. Release of virus by this means and survival of the infected cell to enable the further maturation of viral particles may play some part in the development of persistent infections which have been reported for some coronaviruses including IBV (Robb and Bond, 1979) . The proximal tubular epithelium has been shown to be very sensitive to differences in the osmotic pressure of fixative components (Maunsbach, 1966b; Rothwell, 1978) . Alterations in the concentrations of ions and hence of osmotic pressure initiated by IBV infection will cause changes in the osmotic differential of a fixative which is kept constant.Some of the observed changes in structure may have been related to this osmotic effect of the fixative. With more concentrated solutions, Maunsbach (1966b) observed widened extracellular spaces similar to the spaces observed at day 12, but further evidence that this is an osmotic effect, such as shrunken nuclei and densly staining cytoplasm, is lacking. These widened spaces may be related to the vesicular structures observed by SEM. Permeability of infected cells to trypan blue (Robb and Bond, 1979) may be due to these \\\"holes\\\" in the plasma membrane.Although the primary virus-cell interaction in coronavirus-caused disease is a cytocidal interaction, general cellular protein synthesis is not affected until very late in the infectious cycle (Robb and Bond, 1979) . The evidence presented in our study of structural alterations in tubular epithelial cells during the course of IBV infection indicates that impaired fluid and electrolyte transport is responsible for the kidney disease and renal failure caused by IBV. Further work (Condron and Marshall, 1985) is in progress to determine the alteration in the function of the proximal tubular epithelium and to relate it to the structural changes described in this paper. Whilst stereological methods have been used in a wide range of EM investigations of experimental pathology, to the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a morphometric analysis of ultrastructural changes in an organ induced by a viral infection. These techniques, designed to define the extent and nature of structural changes in all cells in a particular organ, can play a valuable role in determining virus-host cell interactions and the pathogenesis of viral diseases.\\n\\nSUMMARY\\n\\nThe ultrastructure of the proximal tubular epithelial cells in chicken kidneys was examined throughout the course of an experimental infection with infectious bronchitis virus. A quantitative assessment of the structural changes in the cells was related to these in normal cells.Significant alterations were detected in the membrane structures and in the mitochondria.There was a reduction in surface area of the microvillus membrane, the basolateral membrane and the apical tubular membrane. There were alterations in the shape of mitochondrial profiles and a decrease in the volume density of mitochondria.Vesicular structures, which are a possible site of viral release, were observed in the lateral surface of cells.These changes in the functional components of the cells indicate impaired transport of ions and water. The results demonstrate the value of stereological methods for the study of viral-host cell interactions in the pathogenesis of viral disease.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Introduction\\n\\nPorcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), a respiratory variant of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was first identified in Belgium in 1986 (Pensaert et al., 1986 ) . PRCV is morphologically and antigenically similar to TGEV, but it has no tropism for the gut, replicating to high titers in the respiratory tissues of the pig and not inducing intestinal disorders. Instead, it produces mild or inapparent respiratory symptoms, and it affects the growth of fattening pigs (Bourgueil et al., 1992; Lanza et al., 1992) . The humoral immune response elicited by both coronaviruses is indistinguishable (due to common neutralization epitopes) by the classical virus-neutralization test, but small antigenic differences that can be detected by monoclonal antibodies have allowed the development of differential serological tests (competitive *Corresponding author. inhibition blocking ELISA) for both viral infections (Callebaut et al., 1988a,b) .Since its first description in Belgium, PRCV infection has spread throughout Europe in a very short time, and it has been identified in the US (Wesley et al., 1990) . Despite its limited pathogenicity, the epidemiological behavior and the factors associated with PRCV infection may serve as a model for other respiratory viruses, such as Aujeszky's or influenza viruses. The purpose of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of PRCV infection in the largest Spanish region (Castilla y Le6n) and to learn about the factors related to PRCV seropositivity among swine herds.\\n\\nSampling\\n\\nThe target population was the breeding sows of seven provinces of Castilla y Le6n. Geographically, this region covers most of the NW-central part of Spain, and it is a plateau with an average altitude of 700 m above sea level. In April 1988, the breeding sow population in the sampled area was 327 972 animals (nearly 20% of the Spanish breeding sow census).Farms were classified into three different categories depending both on the number of sows and the management practices, as follows:(A) Family farms: this category included herds with 20-50 breeding sows, in which the piglets are usually sold to large fattening farms at weaning age. This type of farm is frequently found in certain parts of the sampled region and represents a secondary income source for many farmers. The production is not intensive and there is a great variability among farms in animal housing facilities, type of feed, management practices and hygienic conditions. Herds with less than 20 sows were not included in this study. (B) Small intensive farms: herds containing between 51 and 100 breeding sows, intensively managed and either performing breeding only or a farrowto-finish operation. (C) Large intensive farms: farms with more than 100 breeding sows, intensively managed, performing a farrow-to-finish operation in which management and hygiene practices, type of feed and housing facilities are very similar among farms and generally satisfactory.Fourteen family herds, 21 small intensive and 23 large intensive farms were selected and sampled. Within each herd, regardless of type, blood was taken from 20-22 sows. Each farm was sampled only once. Both herds and sows within herds were randomly selected from census data, using a random numbers generator.A total of 1247 sows were sampled throughout 1988. Based on the formula (n = Z2pq/L 2) of the approximate 95% confidence interval of the sample size for calculating the prevalence (Martin et al., 1987) the number of sows sampled allowed an absolute error (L) of 2.7% in determining the prevalence of infected animals at the 95% confidence level. As the expected prevalence (p) was unknown, 50% was chosen as the one giving the maximal sample size.Blood was allowed to clot and the serum was separated by centrifugation, coded and kept at -30 \\u00b0C until tested.\\n\\nSerological tests\\n\\nSerum samples were tested first by a monoclonal antibody-capture ELISA (MACELISA) (Lanza et al., 1993 ) , a non-discriminating method which detects antibodies against both PRCV and TGEV. The sensitivity and specificity of this test, as compared with the standard virus neutralization test are 91% and 99%, respectively. In this test, samples were tested in duplicate wells, one containing viral antigen and the other negative control antigen, obtained from mock-infected cell cultures. ELISA values for this test were calculated as the optical densities in the viral antigen wells minus those in the control antigen wells. To assess the consistency of the test, a positive and a negative standard reference serum were tested in each plate. Positive sera were subsequently tested by a competitive inhibition blocking ELISA, as described by Callebaut et al. (1988b) . This test, which uses a TGEV-specific monoclonal antibody as an indicator, specifically detects the humoral immune response produced by TGEV infection and is highly specific in detecting TGEV-seropositive pigs, its sensitivity (85%) being increased when using it on a herd basis.\\n\\nEpidemiological/statistical analysis\\n\\nThe statistical analysis was performed taking the farm as the unit of concern. In order to determine if there were differences in the behavior of PRCV infection among the different farm types that could be explained by differences in its size or management practices, the following data analyses were performed.Comparison of the prevalence of infected farms among the different herd categories. A farm was considered infected when at least one sampled sow was PRCV-seropositive. The number of PRCV-positive and -negative farms was compared among the three farm categories by the Z 2 test at a = 0.05.The occurrence of a positive correlation between herd size and within-farm seropositivity was analyzed with the Spearman's rank correlation. For this purpose, three different ranks of within-farm seropositivity were established: low (1-32%), medium (33-66%) and high (67-100%). (Dean et al., 1990 ) was used.\\n\\nResults\\n\\nBy MACELISA, 392 sows out of the 1247 samples (31.4%) were positive. These positive sera were subsequently tested by the differential blocking ELISA and all proved to be PRCV-specific. In 37 out of the 58 sampled herds (64%), at least one PRCV-seropositive sow was found.The prevalence of infected farms was very similar among the different herd categories, ranging from 59% in large intensive to 71% in family herds. No overall significant differences were found between the different herd categories regarding the prevalence of infected farms ( Table 1 ) . Mean ELISA values of sera belonging to each herd category are shown in Table 2 ; these values were similar for family and small intensive herds, but they were smaller in large intensive farms. Student's t-test showed that mean ELISA values in large intensive herds were significantly smaller than in the other two farm categories. No significant differences were found between family and small intensive herds.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nNeither TGEV nor PRCV has been previously recognized in the sampled area. In a limited sow sera survey performed with samples taken at the slaughterhouse in 1985, Rubio et al. (1987) did not detect TGEV neutralizing antibodies in any of the samples, thus ruling out the presence of both TGEV and PRCV in the area. Three years later, when our sampling was made, the situation seems to have changed completely, since 64% of the sampled farms had PRCV-seropositive sows. This confirms that PRCV spread rapidly among the swine population in Spain, similarly and concurrently to what happened in other European countries (Pensaert et al., 1986) .It is remarkable that TGEV-specific antibodies were not found in any tested animal. TGEV-specific antibodies have been found in sows of two different intensive pig-breeding areas of the Spanish Mediterranean coast (Murcia and Catalonia) (Cubero-Pablo et al., 1990 ) (M. Martin et al., personal communication, 1992 ) . Many piglets are sent from Central Europe to these Spanish regions for fattening. Furthermore, at the time of our sampling, a TGE outbreak was diagnosed in the center of Spain, in a farm which had recently imported pigs from Belgium (Laviada et al., 1988 ) . The reasons why TGE does not seem to have spread to Castilla y Le6n remain obscure, but two facts could explain it: first, the entrance of TGEV infection by means of carrier pigs from other European countries seems unlikely, since piglets are rarely imported to Castilla y Le6n from other European countries; second, the diffusion of TGEV from other parts of Spain is also unlikely, since pig trade between Castilla y Le6n and other parts of Spain is mainly based on the export of piglets which are to be fattened in large intensive units located along the Mediterranean coast. On the other hand, the spread of PRCV seems to be much easier, since it is spread by airborne transmission (Wesley et al., 1990 ).Significant differences were not found in prevalence rates across the different farm categories, suggesting that all types of farms are equally likely to be infected by the respiratory coronavirus, regardless of different management practices and probably due to the great aerogenic diffusion capacity of this virus. On the other hand, we found a very strong correlation between increasing farm size and increasing within-farm seropositivity, indicating that the transmission of this respiratory infection is easier within large animal popu-lations. Henningsen et al. ( 1988 ) in Denmark, found that the probability of a pig being PRCV-seropositive increased while increasing the herd size.Mean ELISA values were significantly lower in large intensive farms than in the rest, which might be explained by higher replacement rate of the sows in this type of farm, while smaller herds tend to keep the breeding animals for a longer time, thus increasing the probability of PRCV re-infections, which causes higher amounts of specific antibodies in serum and then higher ELISA values.This study probably detected the beginning of a PRCV epidemic in the area, leading to a pandemic situation, as happened in the rest of Europe. Even though it is difficult to know what consequences this situation may have in the respiratory pathology of pigs, due to the low pathogenicity of this virus, it has to be taken into account as a part of the etiology of the swine respiratory complex. Also, despite the inconsistent cross-protection provided by PRCV on TGEV infection, this pandemic PRCV situation has occurred concurrently with a sharp decrease in the number of clinical TGE outbreaks in Europe.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Introduction\\n\\nThe intestinal tract, lined by replicating epithelial cells, bathed in nutrient fluids and maintained at optimal temperature provides an ideal milieu for growth of many viruses. 'Enteric viruses' represent a wide spectrum of viral genera that invade and replicate in the mucosa of the intestinal tract, and that can be grouped as follows:. viruses causing localized inflammation at any level of the intestinal tract, predominantly in small intestinal mucosa, resulting in acute gastroenteritis, for example, rotaviruses, caliciviruses, adenoviruses, astroviruses; . viruses that multiply at any level of the intestinal tract, causing few enteric symptoms prior to producing clinical disease at a distant site, for example, measles virus, reoviruses (in mice) , enteroviruses (including polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, enteroviruses, hepatitis A and E); and . viruses that spread to the intestinal tract during the later stages of systemic disease, generally in an immunocompromised host, for example, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cytomegalovirus.This article focuses upon the first category of viruses that cause enteric disease associated with primary replication in the intestinal tract.In the 1950s, the use of monkey kidney cell cultures for the growth of poliovirus revealed the presence of simian viruses and further study showed some of these to have properties consistent with enteroviruses. In parallel, investigations of viruses infecting domestic animals also revealed the presence of enteroviruses (and enteroviruslike particles) in pigs and cattle. Enteroviruses have since been isolated from African buffalo, water buffalo, sheep, goat, deer, and impala and many have been shown to be related to bovine enterovirus isolates.In the past, the classification of enteroviruses was primarily based upon the physico-chemical properties of virions, growth in tissue-cultured cell lines, and by serotyping. In practice, this can be difficult with some isolates being poorly recognized by the reference antisera, or, the occurrence of (misleading) cross-reactivities between serotypes. The expansion of the sequence database together with more sensitive cloning/sequencing techniques have facilitated the elucidation of the genome structures of many picornaviruses. Such analyses have replaced other techniques in the classification of picornaviruses, and this article discusses characteristics which are important for the classification of animal enteroviruses.\\n\\nViruses Associated with Acute Gastroenteritis\\n\\nAcute gastroenteritis is one of the most common health problems worldwide. More than 700 million cases are estimated to occur annually in children less than 5 years of age, resulting in few deaths in developed countries, but more than 2 million deaths in developing countries.Worldwide, a diverse group of viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens cause acute enteric symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, and acute diarrhea. Infections with viral agents, unlike those with bacterial or parasitic pathogens, cannot be treated with antibiotics, and many cannot be prevented by improvements in quality of drinking water, food, or sanitation.Until the early 1970s most viral agents causing gastroenteritis in humans were largely unknown. Studies using electron microscopy of intestinal contents resulted in the discovery of numerous viral enteropathogens now classified as caliciviruses, rotaviruses, astroviruses, or 'enteric' adenoviruses. Caliciviruses are now recognized as the most important cause worldwide of outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis in humans of all age groups. Rotaviruses are the single most important cause of life-threatening diarrhea in children <5 years old. Astroviruses and adenoviruses also cause severe diarrhea in children. Table 1 lists the characteristics of the major viruses associated with acute gastroenteritis. Other viruses linked to gastroenteritis in humans include coronaviruses, toroviruses, picornaviruses, and picobirnaviruses. Understanding many features of these 'enteric viruses' has been based on parallel studies of related viruses infecting animals.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nThe family Caliciviridae contain small RNA viruses that cause enteric disease in a wide variety of hosts including cattle, pigs, rabbits, and humans. Infections in other hosts, for example, sea lions, cats, and primates, appear to cause predominantly systemic and respiratory symptoms. Caliciviruses are small nonenveloped viruses of 27-35 nm diameter ( Figure 1) with a genome comprising a single-stranded positive-sense polyadenylated RNA genome of 7400-7700 nucleotides (nt). Typical calicivirus particles show cup-like hollows (calices) on the virus surface. Some caliciviruses have an indistinct appearance described as 'feathery'.The 'Norwalk agent' (now classified as a calicivirus) was identified in 1972 by Kapikian and colleagues, using immune-electron microscopy (IEM) to search for the causative agent of an 1968 outbreak of gastroenteritis in humans in Norwalk, Ohio, USA. Many related viruses have been implicated as causes of gastroenteritis, and given names identifying the geographical location of the outbreak (e.g., Marin County, Snow Mountain, Hawaii, Sapporo).Virus particles, later classified in the genus Rotavirus, were first described in 1963 by Adams and Kraft as a cause of epidemic diarrhea in infant mice (EDIM). Similar particles (NCDV) were recognized in 1969 by Mebus and colleagues as a cause of severe diarrhea in newborn calves in Nebraska, USA. Neither virus was considered relevant as a causative agent of severe diarrhea in young children until 1973 when Bishop, Davidson, Holmes, and Ruck described a 'new virus' (later shown to be antigenically related to EDIM and NCDV) in duodenal biopsies and diarrheal feces from young children admitted to hospital in Melbourne, Australia with severe acute diarrhea. Named because of their wheel-like appearance in negatively stained extracts examined by electron microscopy (rota \\u00bc Latin for wheel) rotaviruses have since become established as causes of severe acute diarrhea in the young of many mammalian and avian species worldwide. Rotavirus enteritis affects all children regardless of socioeconomic status, and results in over 600 000 deaths annually in young children in developing countries.\\n\\nClassification\\n\\nClassification of caliciviruses was hampered for many years by the inability to culture these viruses, and study their genetic and protein structure. Caliciviruses causing enteric infections (in humans and other animals) are classified as belonging to the family Caliciviridae, which is divided into four genera. The genus Norovirus (NoV), and genus Sapovirus (SaV) cause human and animal infections. Other genera infect rabbits (Lagovirus) or sealions, cats, and primates (Vesivirus). The genome organization and reading frame usage differs between the four genera. For noroviruses, the genome contains three open reading frames (ORFs). The largest (ORF1) encodes a polyprotein which undergoes proteolytic cleavage to produce an NTPase, a 3c-like protease, and an RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). ORF2 encodes the major capsid protein and ORF3 a putative minor capsid protein.Noroviruses are subdivided into five genogroups (GI-GV). Genogroups GI, GII, and GIV infect humans, GIII infects cattle and GV infects mice. GI and GII contain at least 10 and 20 distinct genetic clusters, respectively. Sapoviruses are divided into genogroups (GI-GV), of which GI, GII, GIV, and GV infect humans. GI and GII are further divided into four and three genetic clusters.The inability to culture human caliciviruses delayed the introduction of diagnostic tests, resulting in an under-appreciation of the significance of these agents for many years. Currently, over 20 different reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays targeting regions on the RdRp gene and the capsid gene have been described and utilized in epidemiological studies. This large genetic diversity of human caliciviruses makes routine detection difficult.Rotaviruses are nonenveloped icosahedral viruses of 70 nm ( Figure 2 ) diameter that belong to the genus Rotavirus within the family Reoviridae. The double-stranded RNA genome is contained within a triple-layer of viral proteins (VPs) comprising a core (VP1, VP2, VP3), an inner capsid (VP6), and an outer capsid (VP4, VP7). Rotaviruses are classified into groups A to G based on serology of the VP6 protein. The majority of human and mammalian infections, due to group A viruses, are further classified into serotypes by antigenic differences on VP7 (G-serotypes) and into genotypes by genetic differences on VP4 (P-genotypes). To date there are at least 11 of 15 G-serotypes and 15 of 26 P-genotypes identified in humans. Groups B and C have been identified infrequently in humans. Groups D to G have been identified only in nonhuman mammalian or avian species. \\n\\nGeographic and Seasonal Distribution\\n\\nHuman NoV are the leading causes of 'nonbacterial gastroenteritis' outbreaks in all age groups worldwide. Outbreaks frequently occur in communities such as nursing homes, hospitals, schools, and cruise ships. No consistent seasonal variation has been observed. Infection involves transmission via person-to-person contact or ingestion of contaminated food and water. Epidemiological studies have identified caliciviruses in 60-95% of outbreaks in many countries. Estimates of disease burden in USA suggest that caliciviruses are responsible annually for 23 million illnesses and 50 000 hospitalizations. Strains of NoV GII cluster 4 (GII-4) have been the most common type identified worldwide in the past 5 years (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) in both adults and children. Prevalence rates of calicivirus (predominantly NoV) in young children admitted to hospital with acute gastroenteritis in many countries range from 3.5% to 20% annually. Strains of SaV, while playing a minor role overall, are more generally associated with childhood gastroenteritis than with disease in older children and adults. Caliciviruses may be important enteric pathogens in patients with hereditary or acquired immunodeficiency.EAd40 and EAd41 occur worldwide, causing severe acute enteritis in 5-15% of hospitalized young children. Outbreaks occur at unpredictable intervals year-round with no seasonal prevalence. Nosocomial epidemics occur in day-care nurseries and in hospital wards for children and adults. Group A adenoviruses (serotypes 12, 18, 31) have also been implicated in epidemics, usually in older age groups.\\n\\nGenetics\\n\\nThe genera Norovirus and Sapovirus are genetically diverse, and multiple strains co-circulate in human populations. Individual dominant strains emerge every 2-5 years, and often have a global impact, such as the GII-4 strains identified in USA, Europe, Japan, and Australia in 1995/ 1996 and again in 2004. NoV recombinant strains, with polymerase and capsid genes derived from different ancestral clusters, have been identified in Thailand and Australia. Repeated attempts to adapt NoV and SaV to growth in cell culture have failed. Diagnostic techniques and analysis of antigenic variation rely predominantly on molecular biological techniques. Cloning and expression of the major viral capsid protein (VP1) in baculovirus expression systems has led to the formation of virus-like particles (VLPs) morphologically similar to native virus and their incorporation into enzyme immunoassay (EIA) assays.The rotavirus genome consists of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA that can be separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, allowing epidemiological studies mapping the genetic diversity of strains within and between serotypes. Each gene segment encodes a separate protein, with the exception of gene segment 11 which encodes two proteins. Reassortment of genes between human strains and human and animal strains occurs in vivo and in vitro.\\n\\nPathogenesis\\n\\nPathogenesis of NoV and SaV infection is poorly understood as a result of the long-standing inability to adapt these viruses to cell culture, and the absence of a small animal model. Symptomatic enteritis in human volunteers infected with 'Norwalk agent' showed changes in jejunal biopsies (mucosal inflammation, absorptive cell abnormalities, villus shortening, and crypt hypertrophy) that persisted for at least 4 days after remission of clinical symptoms and reverted to normal after 2 weeks. No identifiable viral particles were detected by electron microscopy in any affected intestinal tissue. The recent demonstration that human noroviruses can infect and replicate in a three-dimensional cell culture model of human intestinal epithelium, should improve our understanding of the pathogenesis, and antigenic diversity of this important group of enteric viruses. These studies will also be enhanced by discovery of a norovirus that infects mice, and that replicates after transfection of cultured kidney cells.Rotaviruses are transmitted from person to person by the fecal-oral route, or via aerosols. Rotaviruses replicate in the cytoplasm of mature nonreplicating enterocytes lining the upper portions of the small intestinal villi, eventually causing cytolysis. Profuse watery diarrhea results from a combination of mechanisms including malabsorption secondary to loss of enterocytes responsible for absorption and digestion, activation of the enteric nervous system, and stimulation of intestinal secretion by the rotavirus nonstructural protein NSP4. Rotavirus antigenemia and viremia occur during the acute phase of severe primary rotavirus disease. As a result, complete rotavirus particles have been found in liver, lung, spleen, pancreas, thymus, and kidneys of experimental animals. It is not clear if the virus is replicating at these sites.EAd replicate within the epithelial cells of the small intestine. Group A adenoviruses have also been grown from mesenteric lymph nodes and appendices. The mechanisms causing diarrhea are not clear, but destruction of infected epithelial cells has a role.Acute astrovirus infection induces a mild watery diarrhea in young children that lasts for 2-3 days and may be associated with vomiting, fever, and anorexia. The lack of a small animal model has hampered studies of the mechanism of astrovirus-induced diarrhea. Experimental models of astrovirus enteritis in turkeys and in gnotobiotic lambs show mild histopathological changes in the intestine (despite high mortality from severe osmotic diarrhea) together with viremia. Experimental astrovirus infection in calves is asymptomatic, with viral replication apparently targeted to M cells. It is possible that none of these animal models illuminate pathogenesis of HAstV infection in humans. Cultivation of HAstV was initially difficult, but can now regularly be achieved using a human colon cancer derived epithelial cell line (CaCo2 cells). \\n\\nImmune Responses, Prevention and Control\\n\\nMechanisms of immunity to NoV are unclear. Infection results in formation of IgG and IgM serum antibody that are broadly reactive within, but not between, genogroups. The role of these antibodies in immune protection is unknown. Infected individuals can develop short-term immunity to homologous viruses but the molecular diversity of NoV circulating in communities makes it difficult to predict whether long-term immunity can develop. It is unclear why a proportion of exposed individuals remain uninfected during outbreaks. Recent studies suggest that histo-blood group antigens and the secretor status may be genetic susceptibility markers for infection. At present the major control strategies for prevention of human calicivirus infection rely on prevention of contamination of food and water supplies.\\n\\nHost Range\\n\\nGroup A rotaviruses infect humans and other mammals repeatedly throughout life. Most primary rotavirus infections in animals occur during the neonatal period. Most primary rotavirus infections in humans occur during the first 24 months of life. Children worldwide will experience at least one rotavirus infection by 5 years of age.In general, group A rotaviruses are species specific. However, rotavirus strains with gene segments of feline, bovine, or porcine origin have been isolated from children, suggesting the occurrence of cross-species infection in nature. Cross-species infections can be established experimentally, and comprise one of the strategies for human vaccine development.\\n\\nClinical Features\\n\\nClinical symptoms in children are strongly influenced by age, with severe often life-threatening diarrhea occurring after primary infection in young children, and in aged people in nursing homes. Excretion of rotavirus particles in detectable numbers (by EIA, RT/PCR) continues for 5-10 days, and occasionally up to 50 days. Excretion can continue for months in immunodeficient children and animals. Reinfections occur throughout life, and are usually asymptomatic or associated with mild symptoms. Symptoms of primary infection require medical attention in 1:5 children, result in hospitalization in 1:65 children and death in 1:293 (almost all in young children in developing countries). Treatment is based upon replacement of fluid and electrolyte loss, usually achieved by oral administration of fluids containing glucose and electrolytes. Occasionally, delayed repair of the small intestinal mucosa is associated with disaccharide or monosaccharide malabsorption leading to malnutrition.Adenovirus diarrhea is more common in infants <12 months old than in older children, and can be protracted with a mean duration of 12 days. Adenovirus diarrhea occurs in immunocompromised patients. Nonseasonal epidemics of EAd diarrhea occur in hospital wards, orphanages, and day-care nurseries. Occasional fatal cases have been reported in children. Evidence from animal models (with non-EAd) suggests that viremia occurs, and can lead to infection of other tissues. The natural history of disease and development of immunity is unknown.\\n\\nImmune Response/Prevention and Control\\n\\nPrimary rotavirus infection protects against severe symptomatic disease on reinfection, and is associated with humoral and cellular immune responses to individual rotavirus proteins. Neutralizing antibody to VP4 and VP7 outer capsid proteins contribute to protection, possibly by interfering with viral replication and limiting the extent of intestinal damage. The role of immune responses to other proteins is uncertain. Virus-specific cytotoxic Tcells are not essential for protection.The importance of rotavirus disease worldwide and its contribution to childhood mortality in developing countries has resulted in strong initiatives, supported by the World Health Organization, to develop live oral rotavirus vaccines to be administered to infants before 3 months of age. Two contrasting vaccines, a single attenuated G1P[8] human rotavirus and a pentavalent human-bovine G1-G4,P[8] reassortant vaccine, have been proved to be safe and effective in preventing severe rotavirus disease. Both have the potential to radically change global childhood mortality and morbidity.\\n\\nHistory and Classification\\n\\nAdenoviruses were first detected in 1953 in cultured fragments of tonsillar and adenoidal tissue from children. They are nonenveloped icosahedral viruses approximately 80 nm in diameter (Figure 3) . The genome is composed of double-stranded DNA. The family Adenoviridae comprises three genera: Mastadenovirus (mammalian) classified into subgenera A-F representing more than 50 serotypes, Aviadenovirus (birds), and a newly recognized genus Atadenovirus identified in sheep and reptiles. Most are readily cultivatable. Adenovirus infections occur worldwide in many mammalian species, are species specific, usually associated with disease in the respiratory, urinary, and ocular systems, and are frequently shed in feces in the absence of any gastrointestinal symptoms.In 1975, Flewett and colleagues in Birmingham, UK, noticed the presence of large numbers of adenovirus particles in negatively stained extracts of diarrheal stools examined by EM. These proved difficult to culture, were designated 'enteric' adenoviruses (EAd), and are now classified as serotypes EAd40 and EAd41 within subgenus group F. Cultivation of EAd remains difficult. The most reliable growth has been achieved in human embryonic kidney cells (293 cells) immortalized by transfection with regions of Ad5.Astroviruses were first described in the UK in 1975 by Madeley and Cosgrove studying an outbreak of diarrhea in newborn babies in an obstetric hospital nursery. Astroviruses are small, round nonenveloped plus-stranded RNA viruses 28-30 nm diameter (Figure 4) occasionally exhibiting virions with a superficial star shape. They are members of the genus Astrovirus in the family Astroviridae. They have been detected in humans (children and adults) and a range of mammalian (sheep, cattle, pigs, dogs, cats, and mice) and avian (turkeys, ducks) species, usually associated with diarrhea. There are currently eight serotypes of human astrovirus, designated HAstV 1-8, based on reactivity with polyclonal antisera. HAstV 1 is most common worldwide.Prevalence rates as a cause of diarrhea vary from 2% to 16% (hospital-based studies), and 5% to 17% (community-based studies). Most astrovirus infections have been recorded during colder months in temperate climates and year-round in tropical countries. A longitudinal study in Mayan children in a poor community in Mexico found a high prevalence (61%) of astrovirus infection in a birth cohort of 271 children followed for 3 years. Infection occurred primarily in infants <12 months old, and showed a high rate of asymptomatic infection and prolonged shedding (2-17 weeks) in many infants. Astrovirus infection has also been associated with persistent diarrhea (lasting for 14 days or more) in children in Bangladesh. Astroviruses are widespread in developed countries, causing outbreaks in day-care centers, hospitals, and nursing homes for the elderly. They are an important cause of enteritis in immunocompromised patients.\\n\\nGenetics/Evolution\\n\\nThe adenovirus virion is composed of at least 10 different structural polypeptides and contains a linear 33-45 kbp DNA. Virus capsomers are arranged as hexons, the corners of which have antenna-like (fiber) projections presumed involved in cell attachment. The DNA genomes of groups A-F are genetically diverse, and differences can be illustrated by analysis using genome restriction endonucleases. The heterogenous genome in groups A-F makes recombination between subgenera unlikely, with exception of groups A and F which show a close evolutionary relationship.Diagnoses of EAd infection rely on EIA that detects the hexon antigen common to groups A-F, followed by determination of restriction enzyme patterns and/or reactions in EIA incorporating neutralizing, monoclonal antibodies specific for Ed40 and 41. \\n\\nGenetics and Evolution\\n\\nThe HAst genome is a polyadenylated plus-stranded RNA molecule of approximately 7 kbp. The genome contains two open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and -1b, code for nonstructural proteins and ORF2 encodes for the capsid protein. Genetic diversity in all serotypes exists, but no association has been shown between serotypes and ability to cause severe gastroenteritis. Astrovirus diagnostic assays include commercially available EIA kits, electron microscopy and RT-PCR detection and genotyping of diarrheal feces.\\n\\nCoronaviruses/Toroviruses\\n\\nMembers of the genera Coronavirus and Torovirus are enveloped plus-strand single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae. Electron microscopy shows them to be pleomorphic fringed particles 100-140 nm at maximum dimension ( Figure 5 ). Coronaviruses and toroviruses can be distinguished by differences in peplomer structure and reaction in IEM using specific antisera.Coronaviruses and toroviruses cause diarrhea, respiratory, and/or hepatic disease in many animal species, including cattle, mice, swine, cats, and dogs. In general, most of these viruses are species specific and disease is most severe in infant animals. Transmission is fecal-oral and due to virus lability may require close contact. Coronaviruses and toroviruses have been implicated in human diarrheal disease but there is still no consensus about their importance. Similar particles have been seen frequently in children without diarrhea, particularly in children in developing countries. Morphological similarities between these viruses and fragments of intestinal brush border make diagnosis difficult. Several studies have implicated coronaviruses as causative agents of necrotizing enterocolitis outbreaks in newborn babies.Toroviruses were first described as a cause of diarrhea by Woode and colleagues in 1979 when Breda virus was identified in a severe outbreak of neonatal calf diarrhea in USA. Toroviruses are now also known to infect horses (Berne virus) and swine. Human infections were first described by Flewett et al. in Birmingham UK in 1984, but have rarely been reported since then.The pathogenesis of diarrhea has been studied in animal models using infection with coronavirus (TGE) in piglets, and with Breda viruses in calves. Both replicate in epithelial cells of small intestine and descending colon causing diarrhea 24-72 h later. Breda virus also replicates in crypt cells.Many animal coronaviruses can be propagated in cell culture. Isolation of human enteric coronaviruses is difficult and serological studies can be confounded by antibody resulting from repeated respiratory coronavirus infection. Enteric infection can be confirmed in feces by detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR, or IEM using antibodies to the viral envelope glycoproteins.\\n\\nPicornaviruses\\n\\nPicornaviruses are 24-30 nm featureless spherical particles containing single-stranded positive-sense RNA. They have been found in diarrheal feces from humans but their etiological role is often not clear. The first clear evidence implicating a picornavirus as an enteric pathogen identified Aichi virus, as a cause of oyster-associated epidemics of gastroenteritis in Japan in 1989. Aichi viruses are now classified as a new genus Kobuvirus within the family Picornaviridae (kobu \\u00bc Japanese for knob). Isolation of Aichi virus in Vero cells has permitted development of EIA and RT-PCR assays based on nucleotide sequence data. Serological assays show seroconversion resulting from infection and a prevalence rate for antibody of 7.2% in Japanese children aged 7 months to 4 years and rising to 80% in adults by age 35.The new genus Parechovirus within the family Picornavirideae contains at least one serotype (previously echovirus 22) that has been implicated as an enteric pathogen in humans.\\n\\nParvoviruses\\n\\nParvoviruses are small 22-26 nm single-stranded DNA viruses comprising a genus Parvovirus in the family Parvoviridae. Some animal parvoviruses have been clearly linked to enteritis including bovine, feline, mink, and canine strains. Canine parvovirus infection emerged after 1977. This lethal neonatal enteric infection, accompanied by viremia and widespread systemic infection, shows a pathogenesis distinct from most enteropathogenic viruses. The virus infects and destroys crypt epithelial cells resulting in flat mucosa with fused and stunted villi. Damage has been likened to that caused by radiation.Other small viruses, resembling parvoviruses, have been seen by EM in diarrheal feces in humans. Evidence linking them to causation of disease is not convincing. They have often been present as dual infections with known enteric pathogens. In addition, their resemblance to some phages makes diagnosis uncertain. \\n\\nBovine Enteroviruses\\n\\nBovine enteroviruses (BEVs) are endemic in cattle in many regions of the world with infection typically Enteroviruses of Animals\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bibliography\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Electron microscopic studies of bovine viral diarrhoea virus in tissues of diseased calves and in cell cultures, H Bielefeldt-Ohmann, B Bloch, Archives of Virology, 1982; Application of stereological methods to cytophysiologic experiments on polarised cells, P H Burri, H Giger, H R Gnagi, E R Weibel, D Chasey, Alexander , D J , Proceedings of 4th European Conference for Electron Microscopy (Rome), 1968; Cytopathology in viral diseases, N F Cheville, Coronaviruses.

Nonpathogenic organisms rapidly populate the sterile intestinal environment after birth, competing with potential pathogens for epithelial attachment sites and nutrients. 1 This blocks successful colonization of many pathogens. 1 Immunoglobulins in colostrum and milk help in preventing pathogenic effects of infectious agents. Organisms also stimulate local immune responses by mucosal plasma cells. Once stimulated, plasma cells produce IgA and IgM, providing additional immunologic protection as early as 5 to 10 days after parturition. 1 Intestinal motility results in confinement of most organisms to the lower ileum and colon. It is important to note this mechanism, as this explains the necessity of sampling from these sites for diagnostic specimens.Inflammed intestines secrete large amounts of fluid, which dilutes pathogenic bacteria or toxins. Damaged epithelial cells are replaced by From proliferating crypt cells. Unfortunately in neonates, this replacement is slow until 10 to 14 days of age. Exposed surfaces are minimalized by contraction of the lamina propria. Local interferon production occurs.l There is a remarkable capacity of the colon to absorb excessive fluid. These factors all provide prevention or control mechanisms for intestinal protection. 1\\n\\nPATHOGENIC MECHANISMS OF DIARRHEA/CLINICAL SIGNS\\n\\nGeneral knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms of diarrhea should help formulate a differential diagnosis list (Table 1) , and lead to the initiation of appropriate therapy and proper sampling for diagnostics and management techniques. Enteric pathogens have a limited number of mechanisms that cause diarrhea. Most common and important in the neonatal pig are: (1) toxic effects on epithelial cells causing fluid loss into the gut lumen, (2) direct destruction and loss of intestinal epithelial cells, and (3) local necrotizing effects on epithelium, lamina propria, or underlying tissues, with invasion of organisms into the lamina propria and underlying tissues. 1 Alterations of intestinal epithelial cells by locally active enterotoxins results in an imbalance of intracellular electrolytes and fluids (secretory diarrhea). Lesions observed include dilated fluid-filled intestines and Loss of intestinal epithelium with subsequent contraction of the lamina propria is recognized at necropsy by a thin-walled intestine and blunting of intestinal villi. Loss of absorptive surface and apical cells results in decreased absorption of ingesta (malabsorptive diarrhea). Undigested content is converted from lactose to lactate in the lumen by bacterial flora, resulting in an acid pH of content of the distal ileum and colon. Lactate, being an osmotically active molecule, draws fluid into the intestinal lumen, resulting in further potentiation of diarrhea. Loss of absorptive apical enterocytes results in poor absorption of other substances such as fat. Consequently, mesenteric lacteals are devoid of chyle or contain less than normal quantities.Localized necrosis of the epithelium and underlying lamina propria initiates watery feces in early stages. Rapid progression of disease results in intestinal contents, which may contain fibrin, necrotic debris, and blood. Intestinal loops frequently are red to red-black and may be characterized by submucosal as well as mural emphysematous pocket formation.\\n\\nCause\\n\\nColibacillosis is the most common cause of enteric disease in neonatal swine. 26 Colibacillosis is caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains. ETECs adhere to mucosal epithelium by pili. Pili associated with ETEC strains producing colibacillosis in pigs include F4 (K88), F5 (K99), F6 (987P), F14, and F18. 3 The combined presence of pili and enterotoxins Sta, 5Th, or LT enables pathogenic E. coli to adhere and multiply on intestinal mucosal surfaces. 3 , 12, 23, 27 Secreted enterotoxins cause severe cellular biochemical alterations leading to clinical diarrhea, dehydration, and high mortality rates. Commonly isolated ETECs belong to 0149, 08, 0147, or 0157, and are F4 positive. 3Transmissible gastroenteritis is caused by a coronavirus. The disease was first described in 1946. 21 Since then, TGE has been reported in most of the major swine-producing countries. TGE is highly contagious. 21 Producers are apprehensive about TGE because (1) mortality in the neonate is high, (2) there is no effective practical treatment, (3) entrance of the virus into a herd is difficult to prevent because of the role of birds, especially starlings, and (4) commercial vaccines available are of limited effectiveness. 4 , 16, 17, 21 Clinical Signs: Acute or Epizootic TGE Acute TGE is generally first observed in growing and finishing pigs on the farm. Pigs in these age groups exhibit generally mild clinical signs of vomiting and diarrhea. Following infection of older pigs, TGE often appears explosively in the farrowing house, with most neonatal pigs becoming ill within a 24-to 48-hour period. Initial signs in neonates are roughening of haircoat, shivering, dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, refusal to nurse, and extreme thirst. Neonatal pigs often attempt to drink water from any source and squeal weakly when handled. This is followed closely by a severe, watery diarrhea that has an acrid odor characteristic of sour milk. Pigs become dehydrated, weak, and die within 2 to 5 days. The mortality rate of pigs under 7 days of age during acute TGE breaks approaches 100%. Mortality is lower in older nursing pigs but can be influenced by stress such as chilling, dampness, and secondary bacterial infection. Lactating sows are susceptible during acute TGE. Sows may vomit, develop severe diarrhea, become anorexic, and cease lactation.TGE infection rate approaches 1000/0 in weaned pigs. Pigs show all the clinical signs of TGE that are evident in nursing pigs. The mortality rate, however, is greatly reduced as pigs are more mature and have more stored energy. Stress factors again may influence the morbidity and mortality. Older growing and finishing pigs, gilts, gestating sows, and boars in the breeding herd can become infected and frequently show inappetence or only a few clinical signs.Even in today's management environment TGE occurs more frequently during winter to early spring months (December to April). In continuous farrowing operations, however, TGE can occur in any season and can affect each subsequent farrowing for several months. TGE virus has been found in feces of pigs 8 weeks after apparent recovery from infection. TGE virus has been found in feces of starlings up to 32 hours after they were fed the virus. 20, 21 Birds carrying the virus have been responsible for contamination of facilities and feed resulting in acute outbreaks in negative units.Rotaviruses are an important cause of diarrhea in swine. Swine rotavirus is ubiquitous and herd infection rates approach 100%?\\n\\nClinical Signs\\n\\nColibacillosis can involve three age groups of pigs: shortly after birth to 4-day-old, 3-week-old, and weaned pigs approximately 7 to 10 days after weaning. There is a high incidence of infection and mortality in 12-hour to 4-day-old pigs. Onset of signs is rapid, often occurring less than 12 hours postparturition, and may occur 2 hours after birth. 26 Listlessness and diarrhea are followed by dehydration, gauntness, and development of a rough haircoat. Perineal skin becomes wet and pasted with yellow fecal material. Marked perineal reddening may be noted. Death often occurs 12 to 24 hours after onset of diarrhea. Mortality can reach 70% in affected litters. 3 Usually not all litters in a farrowing group are affected.Rotaviral infections in pigs have an incubation between 2 and 4 days, depending on virulence of the virus strain, age of the pig, immune status of the sow, and most importantly environmental and management conditions. Field outbreaks of diarrhea can be observed in neonatal pigs but are found more commonly in 2-to 6-week-old animals, as most sows provide degrees of colostral protection. Rotaviral infections limited to neonatal pigs are discussed briefly in this section as a potential differential and discussed further in the article on nursery to grow-finish age animals.Infected pigs become anorexic and depressed a few hours before onset of diarrhea. Vomiting has been observed but is not as common a clinical sign as with TGE. Adult animals generally do not exhibit clinical signs.Diarrhea can be quite severe starting with watery to creamy feces and changing rapidly to profuse yellow to green liquid feces. Diarrhea can last for up to 10 days. Return to normal feces is gradual and may take 1 to 2 additional weeks after recovery from a severe infection. Dehydration is more evident in younger pigs and in those with prolonged diarrheic periods. Morbidity generally is higher than 80%. 19 Mortality can reach 20% in infected animals, although it is often higher in younger pigs. 19 Rotavirus is likely synergistic with other enteric pathogens including E. coli, C. perfringens, Isospora suis, and TGE virus.Clostridial enteritis affects young pigs and is reported worldwide. Other names for clostridial enteritis are enterotoxemia, hemorrhagic enteritis, and bloody scours. The disease usually affects pigs during the first week of life. Nursing pigs up to 1 month of age can be affected.Diarrhea typically begins as a watery yellow scours that may contain traces of blood. After a few hours feces become bloody, and pigs may die within a few hours to 2 days.Coccidiosis affects pigs from 5 to 15 days of age, with the most common range being 7 to 10 days of age. Pigs are often gaunt and dehydrated. Diarrheic feces range in appearance from yellow to graygreen and watery to pasty without blood. Fecal pH is usually acidic (malabsorptive diarrhea). The condition is unresponsive to antibiotics. Morbidity and mortality are variable and often influenced by the presence of secondary bacterial pathogens. 6\\n\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\n\\nA definitive differential diagnosis of colibacillosis requires laboratory confirmation of ETEC strains in feces or intestines of diarrheic pigs. Clinical presentation of colibacillosis and transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is similar in many respects. Some disease patterns can help in the clinical differentiation of these two diseases. Colibacillosis has a shorter age of onset hours) than TGE (approximately 72 hours). Colibacillosis spreads slowly and typically does not affect all litters. Clinically, TGE spreads rapidly, affecting most litters in a short time. In colibacillosis litters from gilts are more frequently affected than litters from sows. Mortality in colibacillosis varies from 5% to 70%, whereas TGE mortality approaches 100% in pigs less than 7 days old. 3 ,21 Sows or older pigs are not affected in colibacillosis but they are in acute outbreaks of TGE. By moistening a strip of pH test paper with feces at the anus, a presumptive diagnosis can be made on the basis of pH of diarrheic feces. A pH of 8.0 or higher is highly suggestive of colibacillosis. Fecal pH in viral or protozoal diarrheas is 7.0 or lower.Diagnosis of TGE is by history, clinical signs, and postmortem examination. Postmortem, the stomach usually contains curdled milk. Small intestinal walls are thin and fluid-filled. Mesenteric lacteals often are devoid of chyle (malabsorptive diarrhea). Villi in the lower two thirds of the intestine are shortened. Intestinal content is watery, yellow, has flecks of curdled milk, and is malodorous.TGE must be differentiated from colibacillosis as described. Diagnostic laboratories can determine the presence of TGE virus in the intestine of pigs in acute stages of diarrhea. Samples taken after 24 hours of diarrhea may yield negative results due to loss of virus by dilution of intestinal contents.Diagnosis of rota viral infection in swine presents some specific problems. Clinical signs of rotavirus and TGE virus infections in pigs are similar especially in cases of enzootic TGE. Generally, villous atrophy produced by TGE is quite severe, but in enzootic TGE, the mild degree of villous atrophy closely resembles that of rotavirus infections making it difficult to separate the two conditions on that basis alone. A number of tools are available in diagnostic laboratories to differentiate the two disease entities, including immunohistochemistry, ELISA tests, fluorescent antibody tests, direct electron microscopic examination, and in situ hybridization as well as dot and slot hybridization. 22Diagnosis is determined by history, clinical signs, postmortem examination, and laboratory assistance in which causative bacteria are identified. Acute disease is characterized by localized epithelial and underlying lamina proprial necrosis inducing watery feces, which rapidly progress to content containing fibrin, necrotic debris, and blood. Intestinal loops are frequently red to red-black and may be characterized by emphysematous pocket formation in the wall. Chronic cases exhibit necrotic enteritis that is difficult to distinguish from other chronic enteropathies, particularly coccidiosis?Diagnosis of coccidiosis is based on history, clinical signs, and postmortem examination. Cases are often randomly distributed within the farrowing unit. Typically, there is no distinctive difference between gilt and sow litters affected. Fecal flotation for coccidia is often unrewarding as oocysts are not detected until 5 to 9 days after infection. Walls of the ileum and distal jejunum are thickened. Mesenteric lacteals are often segmentally devoid of chyle. A mild to severe fibrinonecrotic enteritis usually limited to the ileum and jejunum may be evident. Impression smears of mucosal scrapings and microscopic examination should be used to confirm clinical impressions. Laboratory diagnostics are needed in many cases of coccidiosis to identify associated secondary pathogens as well as to differentiate the disease from chronic C. perfringens, enzootic TGE, and rotaviral infections. 6\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nNumerous treatment regimens are available. Typically regimens are limited to injectable or occasionally oral antibiotics or sulfonamides, fluid replacement, oral dosage of cultures of Lactobacillus acidophilus milk, and increasing the farrowing house temperature.When lactating sows have TGE, their milk production is greatly reduced. Their young pigs also become infected and resulting dehydra-tion is compounded by lack of fluid intake caused by the sow's reduced milk production. Fluid replacement therapy and use of antibiotics to reduce effects of secondary bacterial pathogens are necessary.Fluid therapy; antibiotics; a warm, draft-free environment; and vitamins A, C, and E as indicated for TGE are recommended.Treatment is not effective after clinical signs of clostridial enteritis appear. Administration of type C antitoxin or autogenous type A antitoxin may help in acute and subacute cases. 7 ,24No coccidostats are approved for use in swine. Extralabel uses should be considered with caution and with adherence to appropriate guidelines.\\n\\nControl and Prevention\\n\\nControl of colibacillosis is best accomplished by management practices designed to reduce the problem. The following practices are suggested.1. Transfer the neonatal pig from the birth canal to the sow's teat for an early feeding of colostrum while reducing its exposure to disease-producing E. coli. Good sanitation, a clean sow, and a clean and disinfected farrowing house is mandatory. 2. Keep pigs warm, clean, dry, and out of drafts. 3 . Vaccines containing pili from ETEC strains are available to immunize pregnant gilts and SOWS. 18 Preferably, gilts and sows should be vaccinated at midgestation and again approximately 3 weeks before farrowing. Some situations may indicate the use of Kohler milk vaccine, in which a live unit-specific strain of ETEC grown in milk is top-dressed on gestating sow's feed. 7 This stimulates a good secretory antibody (IgA) response in the sow. Consequently, antibodies should be present in both colostrum and milk. 7 There is an inherent danger in using Kohler milk vaccine as neonates are exposed to live virulent ETEC. Sows must be dosed at least 3 weeks before farrowing to allow time for fecal shedding to diminish? Sows should be dosed in a separate facility from farrowing areas and washed before being moved into farrowing crates. 7 As with all vaccines, efficacy is dependent on adequate milk production by the gilt or sow, as well as the ability of pigs to nurse and ingest sufficient quantities of immunoglobulin. 7\\n\\nChronic or Enzootic TGE\\n\\nEnzootic (endemic) TGE is a persistent form of the disease in which carrier pigs continuously shed virus and infect susceptible pigs. Enzootic TGE is found in those herds with multiple or continuous farrowings so that susceptible pigs are present at all times. TGE has been reported to occur in these herds in pigs as young as 10 days of age, although 10 days to weaning appears to be the most common age of infection.Enzootic TGE has many of the clinical signs seen in acute TGE, but they are less severe in older pigs. Consequently, it is much more difficult to differentiate between enzootic TGE, rotaviral, and E. coli infections. Mild villous atrophy can be found in both rota viral and enzootic TGE infections. Proper laboratory samples and diagnostic tests can distinguish between the two diseases. Dual or multiple pathogen infections are common.\\n\\nControl\\n\\nAvoiding exposure of pigs to TGE virus by isolation of swine units has proved to be highly effective in preventing infection; however, this has left units open to wide-spread severe acute TGE breaks, particularly in early weaned nurseries. Rigid isolation of units from dogs, foxes, starlings, and cats is imperative. These animals have been shown to be mechanical vectors of TGE virus for periods up to 14 days.9, 11,20,28 They are not believed to be natural reservoirs involved in maintenance of the virus through seasonal periods. 9 , 11,20,28 Feeder pigs that may be carriers should not be brought onto smaller units and farms just before or during the farrowing season.All swine producers should practice some of the rules for specific pathogen-free (SPF) programs. These are (1) visitors are not allowed into the swine facility without shower-in-shower-out or at the minimum clean boots and outer garments; (2) trucks and truckers are not allowed near the main breeding herd; (3) new additions to swine herds are isolated a minimum of 60 days before introduction and evaluated serologically for incidence of TGE, porcine respiratory corona virus and other common swine pathogens; (4) movement of dogs, wild animals, and birds are controlled. Modified live virus TGE vaccines are available commercially, although their efficacy is suspect. Maintenance of negative units is far more efficient.Eradication of TGE virus from a herd without depopulation is possible. Eradication is based on the assumption that infected pigs usually do not shed virus longer than 2 weeks. 7 Initially, the herd must be closed with any needed replacements introduced before initiating eradication and should remain closed for at least 6 months? Herd immunity is then brought into equilibrium by dosing all animals deliberately with virulent virus by infecting neonates and feeding back intestinal homogenates to adults. Strict sanitation and all-in, all-out movement is required to eliminate virus in the environment? Approximately 3 months after whole herd dosing, seronegative sentinel animals are introduced. 7 Providing these animals remain seronegative after 30-and 60day tests, successful eradication likely has been accomplished. 7 ,10Good sanitation practices can control the risk of infection with rota virus as with other viruses or bacteria. Immunity to rotavirus in swine follows the same pattern as that of TGE virus infections. Vaccines are available commercially for the immunization of pregnant gilts, sows, and nursing pigs.\\n\\nCLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS ENTERITIS Cause\\n\\nThe bacteria C. perfringens types C and A cause clostridial enteritis.Type A infections are now recognized with increasing frequency in neonatal pigs.24 Pathogenesis of C. perfringens infections is mediated by one or more of nearly 20 potent exotoxins. 24\\n\\nPrevention\\n\\nInjection of type C antitoxin in newborn pigs as soon after birth as possible aids in prevention. This disease can be prevented or the severity reduced in future farrowings by giving sows type C toxoid 10 weeks before farrowing and repeating the injection 3 weeks before farrowing. Presumably, autogenous type A toxoid injection provides similar prevention. 24 Most important is adherence to good sanitation, particularly in regard to cleaning of the sow prior to placement in the crate. Use of prophylactic antibiotics including bacitracin in sow feed beginning 2 weeks prior to farrowing as well as a prophylactic dose of penicillin or amoxicillin given to pigs at birth in units previously diagnosed can be considered?Control of coccidiosis is best accomplished by management practices to reduce exposure. Measures should include all-in, all-out with close adherence to thorough sanitation of farrowing crates. Particular attention should be paid to removal of organic matter. Disinfection with 50/0 chlorine bleach or quaternary ammonia compounds have increased efficacy. Use of raised woven wire or expanded metal crates tend to reduce the incidence but do not replace sanitation practices.The complex nature of neonatal pig diarrhea in conjunction with many of today's management systems makes the expectation of total \\n\\nCOCCIDIOSIS Cause\\n\\n1. suis is the only coccidian associated with clinical disease in neonatal pigs. Coccidiosis is a major problem in systems with continuous farrowing and poor sanitation. Infection is spread by scouring pigs. Sporulated oocysts are subsequently ingested by other pigs, thus perpetuating the cycle. Organisms infect and destroy apical enterocytes resulting in villus atrophy (malabsorptive diarrhea).\\n\\nAntimicrobial Therapy\\n\\nAntibiotic therapy continues to be the most widely used approach for diarrhea in neonatal pigs. Obviously the basic theory is to kill or inhibit offending organisms. Unfortunately, there are many situations in which this approach does not work. These include (1) viral or protozoal etiologies, (2) when rapid reinfection of offending bacterial agents occurs due to environmental contamination, (3) when intestinal damage is severe before antibiotic therapy (e.g., C. perfringens type C infections), (4) when killed organisms release endotoxins as they die, which subsequently harms or kills the pig and, (5) when offending organisms are resistant to antibiotics used. 1 Appropriate antibiotic therapy requires that bacteria be isolated and antimicrobial sensitivities performed routinely.\\n\\nCompetitive Colonization\\n\\nAttempts at populating the neonatal pig with high numbers of nonpathogenic organisms that compete with colonization of pathogenic bacteria have met with variable success. 1 Oral dosing of a high number of organisms such as Lactobacillus spp., enterococci, and nonpathogenic E. coli has been used. Using antibiotics in combination with this type of program is counterproductive. 1 Labor intensity often limits its application in large units if supplemental fluid feeding lines are not in place.\\n\\nPhysiologic Therapy\\n\\nTherapeutic compensation for diarrhea includes rehydration of animals with electrolytes and decreasing ingestion of osmotically active agents. Subcutaneous and intraperitoneal fluid replacement are the only practical routes available in neonatal pigs. While weaning pigs early should in theory reduce the effect of osmotically induced diarrhea, the unfortunate consequence is hypoglycemia and death in pigs less than 2 to 3 weeks of age because of starvation. Concurrently, intestinal repair mechanisms may be impaired so epithelial continuity is not adequately restored before death. Intensity of this therapy option, particularly in today's management systems, typically yields disappointing results. 1\\n\\nImmunologic PreventionlTherapy\\n\\nImmunologic prevention of neonatal pig diarrhea includes endeavors to impede (1) adherence of bacteria of viruses to intestinal epithelium, (2) effects of secretory toxins, (3) penetration of epithelium by bacteria or viruses, and (4) invasion of the lamina propria and subsequently the entire system by organisms. 1 These approaches are open to certain problems including improper selection of organisms for use as an antigen, choosing the proper antigen to ensure preventive effects, route of administration to obtain desired effects, and antibody loss through normal decay and degradation by intestinal proteolytic enzymes. I\\n\\nProtocol for Swine Diarrhea Evaluation\\n\\nDiagnosis of preweaning diarrhea in swine continues to be a part of day-to-day swine practice regardless of the management system or antibiotic availability. Often a broader approach to diagnosis beyond simple bacterial culture and a few snips of intestine for histopathology is required. The following is an attempt to streamline an approach to swine diarrhea diagnostics with the acknowledgment that situations or conditions can vary. Seldom are disease processes singular in any given unit. Evaluation often requires tailoring to specific situations in which case discussion with a diagnostic pathologist is encouraged to provide a source of appropriate tests for you and your client's needs.\\n\\nTissue Submission\\n\\nSamples should be selected from sacrificed untreated animals in acute stages of disease or animals dead for a short period of time (usually less than 3 hours). Submitting live animals to a diagnostic laboratory for a full evaluation may be ideal in some situations. When submitting live animals, attempt to provide a cross-section of clinical presentations. Animals in the acute stage to animals in more advanced stages that have not undergone antimicrobial therapy should be included. Additionally, providing diagnosticians an accurate verbal or written history allows for timely, efficient, and informed decisions on tests as well as approaches to providing solutions.Having appropriate containers for 10% buffered neutral formalin and fresh tissue samples available that are permanently and properly identified before necropsy may seem elementary; however, it provides for a good deal less work in the long run.Collection of blood samples from euthanatized animals for potential testing is always a good idea. Ideally, samples of solid organs for bacteriology should be the first obtained. Fresh lung should be obtained first and packaged separately from other tissues. Fresh samples of liver, kidney, and spleen, should they be warranted, can be packaged together. Samples of intestine should be packaged together and never mixed with other tissue samples. Enteric contents for electron microscopic examination should be placed in a well-sealed container without addition of preservatives. Tissues collected for histopathology should be no greater than 0.25-inch thick and placed in approximately 9 parts 10<Yo buffered neutral formalin to 1 part tissue. Double packaging of formalin-fixed tissues is recommended to reduce risks of leakage that may subsequently render submissions worthless because of drying. Table 2 provides a brief outline of samples for swine diarrhea evaluations.\\n\\nSerology\\n\\nAlthough serology for enteric pathogens is not commonly necessitated in swine, it is often imperative in modem management systems for definitive evaluation of exposure to TGE virus. Screening tests used by most laboratories for TGE serology do not differentiate between antibody to TGE virus and porcine respiratory coronavirus. Differential serologic tests as yet are not widely available but can provide a rapid means, in conjunction with other diagnostic tests, to ascertain exposure to TGE virus.\\n\\nElectron Microscopy\\n\\nAt least 10 mL of fresh cecal and ileal content in a well-sealed container prevention unrealistic. Control at an economic level should be the major objective. Obviously, the occurrence of clinical disease and mortality is dependent on a balance between environmental contamination, degree of colostral immunity, and other resistance factors present in the neonatal pig.Specific management suggestions are difficult because of differences in unit size, facilities, and labor. Broad management principles are most applicable.1. Increase specific resistance of the neonate by vaccination of the dam or neonate. 2. Provide maximum nonspecific resistance with adequate colostrum and optimal animal husbandry practice. 3. Reduce the degree of exposure of neonates to infectious agents and to a stressful environment.Unfortunately there is no vaccination protocol for poor management. Extensive environmental contamination continually exposes neonates to pathogens and provides a significant degree of stress.Chilling is directly responsible for many of the deaths during the first postparturient day and increases susceptibility to disease. 2 ,8 Environmental temperature can significantly affect various aspects contributing to health and development of pigs such as immunophysiology and nutrition. 13, 14, 15 These effects are even more pronounced in neonates owing to their limited ability to cope with thermal extremes. 5 ,15 Further stress is often induced by inconsistencies in temperature where improper thermostatic control or ventilation (drafts) results in undulating temperatures.Environmental temperatures can have a significant impact on the response of neonatal pigs exposed to bacterial endotoxin. 1s Neonatal dependence on a controlled thermal environment increases disease susceptibility and mortality in neonatal pigs housed at cool temperatures. Diarrhea reduces the neonatal pig's ability to maintain its rectal and surface temperature within a cold environment. 1S Behavioral responses of diarrheic pigs tend toward moving to cooler environments for unknown reasons. This gravitation toward cooler thermal zones occurs despite obvious negative physiologic effects. 2 Consequently, diarrheic neonatal pigs require even more attention and care in terms of thermal environment than their healthy counterparts. 2 Unit personnel should be trained to understand these behavioral responses of the neonate to provide efficient and effective care in an effort to reduce mortality.\\n\\nSUMMARY\\n\\nTo be effective, swine practitioners should develop a unit health program. 2S Development should involve unit managers, owners, and employees involved in day-to-day operations. Emphasis on training personnel and management to reduce disease and collection of accurate records is necessary.Routine diagnostics are needed to solve disease problems. Communication with laboratory personnel to ascertain what samples are needed for diagnosis of particular problems cannot be overemphasized. General diagnosis of disease problems outlined by Vinson 2s can be similarly followed within the specifics of diarrheal problems within units. 8 . Evaluate management procedures contributing to the disease problem, i.e., lack of adherence to all-in all-out, rapid turn-around decreasing cleaning time etc. 25 Following this format and communicating with diagnosticians should provide for positive results for the producers both entities serve.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Introduction\\n\\nWild pigs are nearly globally distributed and are hosts for many parasites and bacterial and viral pathogens, some of which are transmissible to agricultural animals, wildlife, and humans (Barrios-Garcia and Ballari, 2012; Bevins et al., 2014) . Numerous studies have investigated the prevalence and distribution of various pathogens in wild pigs and the risk they pose for pathogen transmission in the United States and Europe, but there are relatively few reports from Southeast Asia (Baroch et al., 2015; Hill et al., 2014; Pedersen et al., 2014 Pedersen et al., , 2015 Pepin et al., 2016) . Wild pig populations are increasing dramatically on several Pacific islands, yet data on pathogen exposure are limited or absent.Wild pigs were introduced to Guam, an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the Marianna Island chain, in the late 1600's and despite current liberal hunting regulations, populations continue to increase (Conry, 1988) . This population increase has led to severe ecological damage and agricultural losses. The only report of swine pathogens on Guam was limited to domestic pigs (Dugies et al., 2000) . The lack of data on pathogens in wild pigs is a concern as increased swine populations have led to increased pig-human interactions. Recent reports of leptospirosis in residents and tourists is one concern and although rodents tend be considered the most common reservoir of Leptospira, there is evidence of Leptospira in domestic swine on Guam (Dugies et al., 2000) , and wild pigs in numerous countries have antibodies to leptospires (Jansen et al., 2007; Corn et al., 1986) .In 2015, there was an effort to decrease wild pig populations within fenced areas of two military bases on Guam to minimize the ecological damage caused by the pigs. Samples collected from these animals were used to conduct a comprehensive surveillance project on pathogen exposure of wild pigs on Guam.\\n\\nSites\\n\\nAndersen Air Force Base (AAFB) is a 4135 ha military installation in northern Guam (13.5875\\u00b0N, 144.9244\\u00b0E) . Forested portions of the base contain high quality native habitat, some of which is included in the Guam National Wildlife Refuge. The Naval Base Guam Naval Munitions Site (NBG NMS) is centrally located on the island and covers approximately 5723 acres (13.44000\\u00b0N 144.65250\\u00b0E).\\n\\nSample collection\\n\\nRemoval of wild pigs was conducted via strategic sharp-shooting techniques conducted by well-trained shooters using suppressed 0.223 caliber rifles mounted with scopes. During removal, shooters only fired if the situation met the following criteria: 1) there was certainty that the animal would be dispatched and not escape, 2) if other animals were nearby, every animal had a high probability of being dispatched, and 3) it was safe to dispatch the animal. The shooting methods followed the American Veterinary Medical Association's guidelines for humane euthanasia of animals (AVMA, 2013) . Pigs were aged based on tooth eruption patterns and wear. Animal and sample collection procedures were reviewed and approved by UGA's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (A2014 09-021).Immediately after euthanasia, blood samples were collected via cardiocentesis and placed into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and plain tubes (Greiner Bio-one, Monroe, NC). Clotted blood was centrifuged at 1250g for 15 min and serum was removed and frozen at \\u221220\\u00b0C until diagnostic testing. Whole blood was also frozen at \\u221220\\u00b0C until testing. Representative ectoparasites were collected and preserved in 95% ethanol.\\n\\nDiagnostic testing\\n\\nInformation on pathogens we screened pigs for as well as diagnostic assays and diagnostic laboratories used are listed in Table 1 . Most pigs were serologically tested for all of the pathogens listed; however, due to limited sample volume, some pigs were only tested for selected pathogens. Small sections of lung were fixed in formalin and processed for routine histology. Small sections of kidneys were also fixed in formalin and if antibodies to Leptospira were detected, they were tested for Leptospira antigens by immunohistochemistry (IHC). If any gross lesions were noted during necropsy, they were also collected in formalin for histologic examination. Pigs were not systematically examined for internal parasites, but if any were seen they were collected in formalin for identification.\\n\\nStatistical analyses\\n\\nBody weights were compared between male and female swine using a two-sample t-test. Prevalence of pathogen exposures was compared between males and females and between adult and juvenile swine using Fisher's exact test. All testing assumed a two-sided alternative hypothesis and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using commercially available statistical software (Stata version 13.1, StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).\\n\\nResults\\n\\nFrom the two sites, a total of 47 wild pigs were sampled including six (12.8%) juveniles and 41 (87.2%) adults; 18 (38.3%) were males and 29 (61.7%) were females. Weight (kilograms) was recorded for 32 individuals: 5 juveniles and 27 adults. All juveniles weighed < 11.3 kgs and the mean \\u00b1 SD weight of the 12 adult males (47.1 \\u00b1 16.5) was significantly greater than that of the 15 adult females (25.4 \\u00b1 4.1; P < 0.001).All pigs were positive for at least one of the pathogens included in the study. Exposure to or infection with influenza A virus (IAV), Brucella, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, Babesia spp., transmissible gastroenteritis/porcine respiratory coronavirus and Trichinella spp. was rare or absent (Table 1 ). Based on antibody testing, a high percentage of pigs were exposed to Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia (APP; 93%), Lawsonia intracellularis (93%), and porcine parvovirus (94%). Exposure to multiple serotypes of APP was also common ( Table 2 ). Based on MAT testing, antibodies to four Leptospira serovars were detected in 11 pigs (Tables 1 and 3) , with some individuals having antibodies to more than one serovar. Kidney samples from nine pigs with Leptospira antibodies were negative for Leptospira antigens by IHC.Juvenile pigs had a significantly higher prevalence of antibodies to porcine circovirus type 2 (6/6 [100%]) compared with adults (10/ ; P = 0.017, respectively). There was no difference in prevalence between males and females for any pathogen.Only 38 pigs were examined for ectoparasites; lice (Hematopinus suis) and ticks (Amblyomma breviscutatum) were found on 12 (32%) and seven (18%) pigs, respectively. Lung samples from 32 pigs were examined histologically and eight (25%) were positive for Metastrongylus lungworms. Stephanurus dentatus were found in abdominal lesions from three pigs and one pig had a liver abscess with intralesional nematode larvae which could not be identified.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nOur results indicate that wild pigs on Guam are exposed to multiple pathogens of zoonotic and agricultural importance. Guam has many free-range pig operations which have an increased risk of domestic pigwild pig interactions. Previous work on Guam was restricted to domestic pigs and in contrast to our data, domestic pigs were exposed to relatively few pathogens (Duguies et al., 2000) . Clinically, several diseases were noted, but the only pathogen detected by serologic testing was parvovirus (7/14, 50%). Although domestic pigs were not serologically tested for APP or L. intracellularis, porcine pleuropneumonia and proliferative enteritis were noted. Domestic pigs tested negative for antibodies to pseudorabies virus (n = 65), porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus (n = 16), Brucella spp. (n = 66), Leptospira spp. (n = 52), swine influenza virus (n = 61), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (n = 27), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (n = 70), and Trichinella spp. (n = 53) while we found serologic evidence of the first four pathogens in wild pigs (Duguies et al., 2000) .Porcine pleuropneumonia, caused by APP, is a highly infectious disease that is economically important for domestic swine. Although known to occur on Guam among domestic pigs, prevalence was unknown (Duguies et al., 2000; Boss\\u00e9 et al., 2002) . Clinical disease and mortality resulting from infection with one or more APP serotypes can vary geographically; however, serotype 2 has been consistently associated with morbidity and mortality in domestic pigs (Baroch et al., 2015) . Over half of the wild pigs from Guam had antibodies for serotypes 1-2-9-11. Reproductive disease in domestic pigs due to porcine parvovirus (PPV) has been reported on Guam (Duguies et al., 2000; Ruiz-Fons et al., 2006) . In addition to reproductive failure due to PPV infection, coinfection with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in domestic pigs can result in mortalities (Ellis et al., 2000) . We report in wild pigs the first evidence of PCV2 on Guam; surveillance and vaccination for these pathogens may be warranted. L. intracellularis has been documented worldwide in domestic and wild pigs and is the etiologic agent of proliferative enteropathy (Chiriboga et al., 1999) . The high prevalence of these three pathogens in wild pigs, indicates that transmission to domestic pigs is a risk.Exposure to Leptospira interrogans and Toxoplasma gondii, two important zoonoses, was common in wild pigs on Guam. Leptospirosis is a growing concern in Guam ( Mason et al., 1998) . While exposure to several serotypes was detected, prevalence is likely underestimated because antigens from serotypes readily available for testing in our US laboratory were used rather than those likely present in Guam/other Pacific nations. Regardless, exposure of pigs does not implicate them in human cases due to the diverse reservoir-range, but suggests that proper PPE should be utilized when in contact with pigs. Domestic pigs have not been previously tested for T. gondii but evidence of T. gondii was noted in goats (Duguies et al., 2000) . This parasite has a wide host range and can pose a risk to native avian fauna that do not have an evolutionary history with the parasite (Work et al., 2000) . In addition, T. gondii is zoonotic; due to the popularity of wild pig hunting for sport and population management, hunters in Guam should properly butcher and cook wild pig meat (Hill et al., 2014; Conry 1988) .Several pathogens were not detected or were rare in wild pigs. No evidence of exposure to Trichinella spp., IAV, or coronaviruses associated with enteric and respiratory disease was found; one pig had antibodies to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. Previously, Trichinella was absent from domestic pigs, but because of the zoonotic potential of this parasite, surveillance and education campaigns to ensure pork is thoroughly cooked (which would also kill any T. gondii present) should continue. Swine influenza, a zoonosis, is relatively common in domestic pigs worldwide, but exposure of wild pigs is not ubiquitous and varies geographically (Smith et al., 2009) . While prevalence was high in a study in southern China (Luo et al., 2013) , in Korea, the US and Spain, seroprevalence was generally low (< 20%) and varied seasonally; it is possible that our sample size was insufficient to detect exposure in Guam (Hall et al., 2008; Corn et al., 2009; Feng et al., 2014) . Enteric and respiratory coronaviruses, which have been reported in several Asian countries, are of significant concern due to high morbidity and mortality in na\\u00efve pig populations (Song and Park, 2012) . Porcine epidemic disease virus is clinically similar to transmissible gastroenteritis; both are coronaviruses that can lead to acute diarrhea in all age groups of swine, often resulting in poor body condition or mortalities (Lee, 2015) . One wild pig had antibodies to Brucella; the species could not be distinguished based on serologic testing. Serology indicates if Brucella is present in a population, but culture and/or advanced molecular assays are required to confirm species (Leiser et al., 2013) . Brucellosis, a zoonotic disease, has been documented in wild pig populations globally (Leiser et al., 2013) .Lice (H. suis) were common on Guam, similar to studies on domestic and wild pigs worldwide (Giri\\u015fgin et al., 2009) . H. suis can transmit swine poxvirus and classical swine fever virus but there is no evidence that these viruses are present on Guam. Amblyomma breviscutatum were found on several pigs but little is known about this tick species; it is believed to have been historically present on Guam and other islands in greater Micronesia (Vander Velde and Vander Velde, 2013) . Currently, there are no data on pathogens associated with A. breviscutatum. Our testing method for helminth parasites was limited due to time and Cleveland et al. Veterinary Microbiology 205 (2017) 22-25 importation restrictions; we only examined small sections of lung tissue (or lesions if noted). Confirmed infections with Metastrongylus lungworms and S. dentatus were relatively common, and likely underrecognized because of testing method. Both Metastrongylus lungworms and S. dentatus, previously reported in domestic pigs on Guam, can impact domestic pig health (Duguies et al., 2000) .\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nOur study highlights the importance of surveillance efforts for pathogens transmitted by wild pigs on Guam as many of the pathogens circulating in wild pigs can cause disease in domestic swine. We detected serologic evidence for multiple zoonotic pathogens, necessitating simple yet effective preventative measures. Wearing appropriate PPE, practicing good hygiene, washing all utensils and surfaces that have come into contact with butchered wild pigs, and thoroughly cooking meat prior to consumption may assist in preventing infection. Management of wild pigs is often controversial as they are seen as a food source for hunters or in some cases may be considered native species. The wild pig populations on Guam are not native, harbor pathogens of importance to domestic swine and people, and very importantly, cause major damage to the environment leading to economic losses for farmers and extreme habitat destruction for native species of wildlife.\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":

Recognition of infection by NK cells is accomplished by the activation of receptors on the NK cell surface, which initiate NK cell effector functions. Many of the receptors and ligands involved in NK cell antimicrobial activity have been identified, and we are beginning to appreciate how they function during infection. In addition, NK cells are activated by cytokines (e.g. interleukin 12 and type I interferons), which are products of activated macrophages and dendritic cells. In response to these activating stimuli, NK cells secrete cytokines and chemokines and lyse target cells. Recent studies have focused on the mechanisms by which NK cells recognize and respond to viruses, parasites and bacteria, and on the unique role of NK cells in innate immunity to infection.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nNatural killer (NK) cells represent a distinct subset of lymphoid cells that have innate immune functions [1] . Derived from the bone marrow, NK cells circulate in the blood and become activated by cytokines or upon encountering target cells that express ligands for NK cell receptors [2] . NK cell receptors are encoded in the germline and do not undergo somatic recombination like Band T-cell antigen receptors; it is the balance of signals from activating and inhibitory receptors that determines the outcome of NK cell activity. Some inhibitory receptors recognize MHC class I, which is present on virtually all healthy cells, and prevent NK cell attack against these cells. Loss of MHC class I from cells owing to infection or transformation can lead to NK cell activation, as proposed by the 'missing self hypothesis' [3] , provided that an activating receptor is engaged. These activating NK receptors bind to host-derived or pathogen-encoded ligands that are up-regulated on 'stressed' or infected cells. Upon activation, NK cells directly lyse target cells by exocytosis of perforin and granzymes and secrete cytokines, such as interferon (IFN)-g and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, which mediate their immune response to infection. In this manner, NK cells function as important sentinels of the immune system, working as primary responders and alerting the host to the presence of infectious organisms.In this review, we will highlight recent studies on the mechanisms by which NK cells recognize and respond to viruses, parasites and bacteria, and will underscore the unique role of NK cells in innate immunity to infection (Table 1) .\\n\\nNatural killer cells and viral infections\\n\\nNatural killer cell-dendritic cell interactions and Toll-like receptor 9 NK cells can respond to infection either directly or indirectly. They respond directly by recognizing virusinfected cells, and indirectly by interacting with dendritic cells (DCs), which express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and secrete cytokines in response to encounter with microbes.Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) recognizes unmethylated CpG DNA, a component of bacterial and viral DNA, and signals for cellular activation through the adapter protein MyD88. Several groups have recently examined the role of TLR9 and MyD88 in response to mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection by using MyD88deficient or TLR9-deficient mice. These immunodeficient mice had elevated amounts of virus in their spleens and livers compared with wild-type mice, which indicates an increased susceptibility to infection and suggests a crucial role for TLR9 and MyD88 in immunity to MCMV [4,5,6 ,7 ] . Infection by MCMV activated IFN-producing cells and myeloid DCs, resulting in the production of IFN-a and IL-12 through pathways dependent upon MyD88 and TLR9 [5] . Mice that lacked MyD88 or TLR9 had reduced amounts of IFN-a and IFN-b, interleukin (IL)-12, macrophage inflammatory protein 1a (MIP-1a) and IFN-g in their sera [4, 5, 6 ] . Of note, NK cells from MCMV-infected TLR9-and MyD88deficient mice produced less IFN-g [4, 5] , had impaired proliferation, and displayed reduced cytolytic activity compared with NK cells from MCMV-infected wild-type mice [5] . In addition, MCMV-infected CD11b + DCs directly activated NK cell IFN-g production by a mechanism that required IFN-a and the NKG2D receptor on NK cells [6 ] .Collectively, these data suggest that IFN-producing cells and DCs are activated by MCMV through a TLR9-and MyD88-dependent pathway to produce type I IFNs and IL-12. These cytokines stimulate NK cell IFN-g production and cytotoxic activity and ultimately control the viral infection ( Figure 1 ). In another report, it was found that sera levels of IFN-a in TLR9-deficient mice were unchanged compared with wild-type mice, indicating that IFN-a production in response to MCMV infection is independent of TLR9 [7 ] . Further studies will be necessary to resolve these differences.Natural killer cell antiviral effector mechanisms NK cells use two main effector mechanisms to control MCMV infection: the secretion of IFN-g and direct lysis of infected cells by exocytosis of granules that contain perforin and granzymes. Using mice deficient in perforin or IFN-g and mice depleted of IFN-g by antibody, organspecific control of MCMV infection by NK cells was observed: perforin mediated viral clearance in the spleen and IFN-g mediated protection in the liver [8] . A recent study re-evaluated the importance of these two effector mechanisms during MCMV infection and found that mice deficient in perforin or IFN-g had elevated viral 392 Host-pathogen interactions Table 1 NK cells in immunity to pathogens.\\n\\nPathogen\\n\\nMechanism of action References Viruses MCMV TLR9 and MyD88 activation of DC-induced IFN-a and IL-12 production; this leads to NK cell IFN-g production and cytotoxicity [4,5,6 ,7 ] Perforin and IFN-g generation by NK cells limits viral replication in the spleen and liver [8, 9] MCMV m157 binds Ly49H, induces NK cell IFN-g, MIP-1a, MIP-1b, RANTES and ATAC, and controls MCMV in C57BL/6 mice [17, 18, 19, 20 ] NK cells mediate resistance in NZW mice by multiple gene products [21] NK cells protect MA/My mice from infection; Ly49P recognizes H-2Dk-restricted ligand in MCMV-infected cells [22 ,23 ] KLRG1 + NK cells expand and contract in response to infection [26] HCMV NK cell IFN-g, LTa/b and TNF induce IFN-b from infected cells and inhibit HCMV replication [10] A truncated form of MICA escapes HCMV down-regulation and activates NK cell NKG2D [13] CD94-NKG2C + NK cells preferentially expand in response to infected fibroblasts [25] Sendai virus Viral infection induces IFN-a and MICB gene transcription; this leads to NK cell IFN-g production [11] Influenza A virus Viral infection induces IFN-a and MICB gene transcription; this leads to NK cell IFN-g production [11] HIV Neonatal NK cells suppress replication of CCR5-trophic viruses [29] NK cells from viremic patients produce more IFN-g and TNF-a than NK cells from aviremic patients [30] MHV NK cell recruited to the CNS after intracerebral MHV infection enhance survival and decrease viral titers [33] Ebola titers in the spleen and the liver three days post-infection compared with wild-type C57BL/6 mice [9] . By six days post-infection, viral titers in the spleens and livers of perforin-deficient mice remained higher than those of wild-type mice, whereas viral titers in IFN-g-deficient mice were higher only in the livers [9] . The authors noted that the differences observed between their work and the previous study might reflect the background of the mice used in the experiments, because MCMV resistance varies by mouse strain. The original study used perforin-deficient mice on a C57BL/6 \\u00c2 129 mixed genetic background, whereas the recent study used mice on a C57BL/6 background. It is conceivable that NK cells in different mouse strains use distinct antiviral effector mechanisms in different organs.Lymphotoxin (LT) and IFN-b have recently been implicated in non-cytolytic NK cell control of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. When cultured with HCMV-infected fibroblasts, IL-2-activated NK cells produced IFN-g and induced IFN-b production by the infected cells, which inhibited spread of the virus [10] . IFN-b induction appeared to involve NK cell secretion of LTab and TNF, as soluble decoys of both of these molecules prevented HCMV inhibition [10] .IFN-g production by NK cells might also contribute to protection against influenza A and Sendai viruses. Contact between human NK cells and virus-infected macrophages induced NK cell-mediated IFN-g production [11] . In addition, gene transcription of IFN-g and major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain B (MICB), a ligand for the NKG2D receptor, by the NK cells was enhanced by virus-induced IFN-a, which indicates interplay among type I and type II IFNs during influenza A and Sendai virus infections [11] .\\n\\nHuman cytomegalovirus infection modulates natural killer cell receptor function\\n\\nSeveral studies have examined the effect of CMV infection on ligands for NK cell receptors [12] . Recent experiments analyzing the NKG2D ligand MICA demonstrated that HCMV infection down-regulated a full-length isoform of MICA from the surface of infected fibroblasts, preventing lysis by the human NK cell line NKL [13] . However, a truncated form of MICA, which lacks a cytoplasmic tail owing to a frameshift mutation, was stably expressed on the surface of infected fibroblasts and was efficiently lysed by NKL [13] . Interestingly, the truncated allele was found to be the most common allele in several human populations [14] , which suggests that polymorphism in the MICA gene might allow for enhanced viral clearance through NKG2D-dependent activation of NK cells. CD155, the ligand for the NK cell activating receptors DNAM-1 (CD226) and TAC-TILE (CD96), was targeted for down-regulation by the HCMV glycoprotein UL141, rendering infected cells resistant to NK cell lysis [15 ] . Down-regulation of CD155 only occurred during infection of fibroblasts with low-passage strains or clinical isolates of HCMV, and UL141 functioned by preventing maturation of CD155 and retaining it in the endoplasmic reticulum [15 ] .An intriguing story has emerged regarding the ability of the HCMV tegument protein pp65 to modulate NK cell killing through the NKp30 receptor. Arnon et al. [16] reported that pp65 binds to NKp30 and inhibits NKp30mediated NK cell lysis of HCMV-infected targets. Surprisingly, pp65 appeared to cause dissociation of NKp30 from its signaling component, CD3z, thereby inhibiting NKp30 activity [16] . The mechanism by which a virion tegument protein, such as pp65, might access the interaction site between NKp30 and CD3z on the NK cell plasma membrane remains unclear and will require further investigation.\\n\\nNatural killer cells mediate host resistance to murine cytomegalovirus by diverse mechanisms\\n\\nResistance of C57BL/6 mice to MCMV infection is mediated predominantly by the recognition of m157a viral protein expressed on infected cells -by NK cell activating receptor Ly49H [12] . Ligation of Ly49H by m157 during MCMV infection results in the release of cytokines and chemokines, including IFN-g, MIP-1a, MIP-1b, RANTES and ATAC, which might play a role in containing the infection [17] . A mutant virus that lacks the m157 open reading frame displayed enhanced virulence compared with wild-type MCMV in C57BL/6 mice, which indicates that recognition of m157 by Ly49H governs innate immune control of infection [18] . This idea was reinforced by the emergence of viral escape variants that have mutations in the m157 gene during infection of C57BL/6 mice that lack adaptive immunity [19, 20 ] . In this manner, Ly49H + NK cells might drive the evolution of viruses that can escape from innate immune control.Like C57BL/6 mice, New Zealand White (NZW) mice are resistant to MCMV infection by use of an NK celldependent mechanism; depletion of NK cells with anti-NK1.1 antibody resulted in elevated MCMV titers in the spleen and liver [21] . However, resistance was independent of Ly49H and m157, as NZW mice do not possess a Ly49H gene. Moreover, treatment with an anti-Ly49H antibody, which conferred MCMV susceptibility in C57BL/6 mice, had no effect on viral titers in NZW mice [21] . When MCMV-resistant NZW mice were mated and backcrossed with other MCMV-sensitive mouse strains, resistance was shown to be mediated by multiple gene products [21] , which remain to be identified.NK cells also mediate immune protection against MCMV in the MA/My mouse strain, which lacks the Ly49H receptor. Genetic analysis has revealed that MA/My resistance to MCMV is dependent both on the H-2 k haplotype [22 ,23 ] and on a locus in the 'NK gene complex', a region of mouse chromosome 6 that contains a cluster of genes preferentially expressed by NK cells [22 ] . Examination of the activating Ly49 receptors in the MA/My strain identified Ly49P to be the only activating Ly49 capable of responding to MCMV-infected cells [22 ] . Although the ligand for Ly49P on MCMV-infected cells has yet to be identified, it appears to be a ligand associated with H-2D k because antibody blockade of either Ly49P or H-2D k prevented Ly49P reporter cell recognition of MCMV-infected cells [22 ] .The ability of wild mouse populations to control MCMV infection was recently investigated. Viral replication in the spleens and livers of wild outbred mice housed in a specific pathogen-free facility was similar to growth of the virus in 'MCMV-susceptible' BALB/c inbred mice [24] .Cytomegalovirus infection promotes the outgrowth of specific natural killer cell populations NK cells are a heterogeneous population composed of cells that express overlapping subsets of activating and inhibitory receptors. When human peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured with HCMV-infected fibroblasts, NK cells that express the activating CD94-NKG2C receptor preferentially expanded. Expansion was contingent on viral replication, on direct contact between lymphocytes and infected cells, and on signaling through the CD94-NKG2C-DAP12 receptor complex [25] . Interestingly, a MCMV viral mutant that lacked the US2-11 genes, and therefore could not down-regulate MHC class I, did not drive expansion of this population [25] . Whether the ligand for CD94-NKG2C (i.e. HLA-E) plays a role in proliferation of CD94-NKG2C + NK cells in response to HCMV-infected fibroblasts awaits further investigation.In the mouse, MCMV infection induces phenotypic maturation of NK cells, including expression of killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1) [26] , which was recently identified to be a receptor for E-cadherin [27, 28] . Tracking of KLRG1 + cells indicated that NK cells activated by MCMV expanded in response to infection and then contracted owing to cell death. A KLRG1 \\u00c0 population remained, which could respond to secondary infection [26] . Thus, CMV infection might shape the NK cell repertoire, leading to the selective expansion of specific NK cell subsets.\\n\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus infection and natural killer cells\\n\\nNeonatal NK cells might play a crucial role in protection from perinatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. When cultured with autologous human HIVinfected CD4 + T cells, neonatal NK cells suppressed HIV replication to a greater degree than adult NK cells [29] . Suppression was dependent on a chemokine-mediated mechanism and on infection with a CCR5-dependent virus, because NK cells could not suppress HIV replication by a CXCR4-dependent virus [29] .Highly active antiretroviral therapy can reduce HIV replication and can result in a decrease in viral load in the blood, known as viremia, of responsive patients. Analysis of NK cells in chronically infected viremic and aviremic HIV-1 patients found that the number of CD3 -CD56 + NK cells in the blood was dramatically reduced in patients that had ongoing viral replication compared with uninfected or aviremic patients [30] . However, a greater percentage of NK cells from viremic patients, compared with aviremic patients, produced IFN-g and TNF-a and expressed higher levels of CD107a -a marker of granule exocytosis -after stimulation with the tumor cell line K562 [30] . Thus, NK cell activity is augmented in HIV-1 patients that have ongoing viral replication in the blood, although total numbers of NK cells are reduced.It has long been appreciated that HIV infection downregulates expression of MHC class I. A recent study revealed that certain strains of HIV selectively downregulated HLA-A2 and HLA-B7, but not HLA-C or HLA-E, on infected cells [31] . HLA-C and HLA-E on HIV-infected T cell blasts engaged inhibitory killer-cell Ig-like receptors (KIRs) or CD94-NKG2A receptors, respectively, on NK cells, inhibited killing of the virusinfected cells [31] , and blocked antibody-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity against HIV-infected cells coated with anti-gp120 [32] . The ability of certain HIV-1 strains to selectively modulate MHC class I on infected cells might determine whether or not NK cells can respond to the infection.\\n\\nNatural killer cell recruitment to the central nervous system during viral infection\\n\\nThe chemokine CXCL10 might be crucial for innate immunity to coronavirus because it recruits NK cells to the central nervous system (CNS) during infection. Intracerebral infection of RAG1 \\u00c0/\\u00c0 mice with a CXCL10expressing mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) resulted in the rapid infiltration of NK cells to the CNS, which correlated with delayed mortality and reduced viral titers compared with animals infected with wild-type virus [33] . Enhanced IFN-g secretion by NK cells was also observed and was found to be essential for the antiviral effect, possibly by limiting MHV replication [33] .\\n\\nNatural killer cell protection during Ebola virus infection\\n\\nThe role of NK cells was examined in protection against Ebola virus that was induced by treating mice with nonreplicating Ebola virus-like particles (VLPs) and then challenging mice with a lethal dose of Ebola virus. VLP immunization enhanced NK cell numbers in the lymph nodes and spleens, increased NK cell secretion of IFN-g and TNF-a, and induced cytotoxic activity [34] . Depletion of NK cells from mice prior to treatment with VLPs resulted in decreased survival after infection with Ebola virus compared with undepleted mice, and adoptive transfer of NK cells activated by VLPs into na\\u00efve mice enhanced their survival after Ebola infection, further implicating NK cells in immunity to Ebola virus [34] . Perforin, but not IFN-g, was shown to be required for the protective effect. Although not addressed in this report, the VLP-activated NK cells presumably augmented an adaptive immune response that was responsible for protection against challenge with Ebola virus.\\n\\nNatural killer cell activation during parasitic infection\\n\\nNatural killer cells respond to Plasmodium falciparum NK cells play an important role in the host response to infection with Plasmodium falciparum -the causative agent of malaria [35] . IFN-g production by human NK cells cultured with red blood cells (RBCs) infected with P. falciparum was dependent on IL-12 and IL-18 derived from myeloid cells in the cultures [36] ; the amount of IFN-g generated by NK cells responding to infected RBCs varied by donor [37 ,38 ] . It has been proposed that the CD56 bright subset of human NK cells is responsible for cytokine production, whereas the CD56 dim NK cells are responsible for cytolytic activity. When stimulated by malaria-infected erythrocytes, however, both NK cell subsets produced abundant IFN-g [37 ] . Culture of NK cells with RBC infected by several different strains of P. falciparum also up-regulated CD69 and CD25 activation markers on NK cells from all donors.The cellular and molecular requirements for NK cell activation by malaria-infected RBCs have recently been examined. Transwell assay experiments revealed that NK cell IFN-g production required contact of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with infected RBCs, and that NK cells produced IFN-g only in the presence of PBMCs [39] . NK cells formed stable conjugates with infected RBCs [39] , and in some cases reorganized the actin cytoskeleton after conjugate formation [37 ] . Purified NK cells, however, only produced substantial amounts of IFN-g in the presence of monocytes [38 ] . In addition, IL-18 production by macrophages and MyD88 expression in both NK cells and macrophages were required to induce IFN-g production by mouse NK cells in response to infected RBCs [38 ] . Although NK cells can interact with infected RBCs, robust NK cell activation seems to require secretion of soluble mediators by macrophages or monocytes. Specific NK receptors involved in recognition of infected RBCs have not been defined; however, in humans, KIR molecules might play a role, because associations were found between the KIR genotype and donor susceptibility to malaria [39] .\\n\\nThe natural killer complex and Plasmodium berghei pathogenesis\\n\\nThe NK complex (NKC; a region on mouse chromosome 6 containing several genes preferentially expressed by NK cells) appears to contribute to pathogenesis of malaria infection with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. C57BL/6 mice succumb to severe infection with P. berghei ANKA, whereas BALB/c mice are resistant. When BALB/c mice congenic for the C57BL/6 NKC were infected with P. berghei ANKA, parasitemia was unaffected but parasitespecific antibody responses, pro-inflammatory gene expression, and the TH1/TH2 balance were altered [40] .\\n\\nNatural killer cell activation by infection with\\n\\nTrypanosoma cruzi NK cells might also play a role in protection against Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Depletion of NK cells from mice using the anti-asialo GM1 antibody did not affect survival when a low dose (1 \\u00c2 10 4 ) of T. cruzi trypomastigotes was used for infection [41] ; however, when a higher dose was used (5 \\u00c2 10 5 ), NK-depleted mice had compromised survival compared with C57BL/6 mice [42] . Interestingly, increased parasitemia was observed in NKdepleted mice infected with the lower dose of T. cruzi, possibly because NK cells could form intimate interactions with trypomastigotes and contribute to their lysis [41] . Lysis was independent of perforin but dependent upon IL-12 [41] , which suggests that monocytes or macrophages activated by T. cruzi might contribute to NK cell activation by producing IL-12. NK cell cytotoxicity and protection against T. cruzi infection was independent of NK T cells [42] .\\n\\nNatural killer cells and bacterial infection\\n\\nThe importance of NK cells in protection against bacterial infection has been controversial and might vary depending upon the site of infection or type of inflammatory response elicited. Mice deficient in the RAG2 and common g-chain genes (RAG \\u00c0/\\u00c0 gc \\u00c0/\\u00c0 ) lack B, T and NK cells and can be used to assess the contributions of these cell types in the immune response. After infection with Shigella flexneri, RAG \\u00c0/\\u00c0 gc \\u00c0/\\u00c0 mice had severely compromised survival compared with wild-type mice, possibly owing to reduced production of IL-1, IL-6, TNF and IL-12 [43] . Interestingly, RAG \\u00c0/\\u00c0 mice, which have NK cells, had lower bacterial titers and increased survival compared with RAG \\u00c0/\\u00c0 gc \\u00c0/\\u00c0 mice, suggesting that NK cell production of IFN-g alone might limit infection [43] . If this is the case, it would be expected that depletion of NK cells from RAG \\u00c0/\\u00c0 mice would lead to an exacerbated disease phenotype.One mechanism by which NK cells can modulate their activity during infection is by altering receptor expression. Human NK cells cultured with Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected monocytes up-regulated expression of the activating receptors NKp30, NKp46 and NKG2D and lysed infected monocytes through NKG2D-and NKp46dependent mechanisms; this is known because antibodies against these receptors inhibited cytotoxicity [44] . Infection of monocytes resulted in up-regulation of the NKG2D ligand ULBP1 through TLR2 activation [44] . Thus, NKG2D and NKp46 might mediate the NK cell response to M. tuberculosis infection. However, depletion of NK cells in mice infected with M. tuberculosis did not affect the bacterial load [45] .Although previously suggested to provide a protective role in response to the intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes (LM), NK cells might not be involved in bacterial clearance [46] . Recent work by Berg et al. [47] has shown that when OT-1 TcR transgenic T cells were transferred into IFN-g-deficient hosts prior to infection with LM, these T cells secreted IFN-g and reduced the bacterial burden, despite the fact that these T cells recognized ovalbumin and not Listeria. This suggests a bystander 'innate' role for the T cells [47] . In addition, the transferred T cells localized with macrophages and LM lesions in the spleen and liver. By contrast, when NK cells were adoptively transferred into these recipients, the NK cells localized to the splenic red pulp, away from infected foci [47] . In this study, CD8 + T cells were shown to be the more significant player in innate immunity to LM.Interestingly, recent reports have revealed that type I IFN hinders host control of LM, as mice deficient in this signaling system had reduced bacterial burdens and enhanced survival compared with wild-type mice [48] [49] [50] . Because NK cells are activated by type I IFN, it might be that NK cells worsen disease rather than protect the host from LM infection. This is consistent with the finding that mice that lack the DAP12 adapter protein, which associates with several NK and myeloid cell activating receptors, exhibited enhanced TLR responses and better control of bacterial infection [51] .\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nAlthough originally identified by their ability to kill tumors, emerging evidence strongly implicates NK cells in host protection against microbial pathogens. In particular, a role for NK cells in host defense against CMV in humans and mice is supported by the existence of viral mutation in response to NK cell-mediated immunity and the evolution of viral proteins that target the NKG2D ligands in CMV-infected cells. Although less well-studied, a developing theme is anti-parasitic and anti-bacterial immunity resulting from the interplay of NK cells with DCs and macrophages. However, NK cells might not always be beneficial in immune responses, as highlighted by recent observations that NK cells might promote the growth of rather than protect against LM. The future promises a better molecular definition of the mechanisms by which NK cells participate in innate immunity against these pathogens.Have you contributed to an Elsevier publication?

In par-ticular, viruses must overcome the potent antiviral and inflammatory effects of innate immune cytokines such as type I interferon (IFNab) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa). The induction and activity of these antiviral cytokines is controlled by, among other factors, Ub and Ublike (UBL) molecules (Kirkin and Dikic, 2007) . The activation of the transcriptional regulator nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) by TNFa was one of the first immune regulatory pathways found to be dependent on protein ubiquitination (Karin and Ben-Neriah, 2000) . NF-kB is sequestered in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells through binding to IkB. TNFa binding to its receptor induces IkB phosphorylation followed by K 48 -linked poly-ubiquitination targeting IkB for proteasomal degradation. This releases NF-kB dimers for translocation to the nucleus, where they regulate transcription. NF-kB-induced genes include type I IFN and other cytokines, hence this Ub-controlled pathway plays a vital role in innate and adaptive immunity, as well as in inflammation (Tergaonkar, 2006) . In addition to ubiquitination of IkB, K 63and K 48 -linked ubiquitination regulates other molecules involved in this signaling pathway (Chen, 2005) .ISG15 is an interferon-induced UBL molecule with important antiviral activity against Sindbis, herpes simplex, influenza A, and influenza B viruses (Lenschow et al., 2007) . ISG15, like Ub, is covalently conjugated to target proteins via a C-terminal LRLRGG sequence (Haas et al., 1987; Loeb and Haas, 1992; Narasimhan et al., 1996) . Although conjugation is critical for the antiviral activity of ISG15 (Lenschow et al., , 2007 , the mechanism by which ISG15 mediates its antiviral function is not completely understood.Ub and ISG15 are synthesized as inactive precursors with C-terminal extensions that undergo cleavage to reveal the motif required for conjugation. Coordinated activities of an enzymatic cascade comprising an activating enzyme (E1), a conjugating enzyme (E2) and a ligase (E3) result in the conjugation of Ub or ISG15 to the 3-amino group of a lysine residue present in the target protein.Both Ub and ISG15 conjugation can be reversed by the activity of deconjugating enzymes. Deubiquitinating (DUB) proteolytic enzymes are also involved in processing of Ub precursors. Five classes of DUBs have been described (Nijman et al., 2005) ; one of the most recently identified is the ovarian tumor (OTU) domain family. This family comprises a group of putative cysteine proteases, homologous to the OTU protein in Drosophila, and includes more than a hundred proteins from eukaryotes, bacteria, and viruses (Makarova et al., 2000) . Several OTU domain-containing mammalian proteins, such as Cezanne (Evans et al., 2003) , Otubain 1 and 2 (Balakirev et al., 2003) , and A20 (Evans et al., 2004) have been identified as proteases that participate in substrate-specific deubiquitinating processes. For example, A20 is an important downregulator of TNFa signaling via its deubiquitination of TRAF6 and its dual function of poly-Ub 63 deconjugation followed by poly-Ub 48 modification of RIP (Wertz et al., 2004) . These activities are mediated by its N-terminal OTU domain and its C-terminal zinc finger domain, respectively. However, the substrate specificity and physiologic role of most OTU domaincontaining proteins remains unknown.As protein ubiquitination and ISGylation are both important for innate immunity, rely on terminal LRLRGG sequences, and share a common mechanism of conjugation, we tested the hypothesis that viral OTU domain-containing proteases regulate Ub-and ISG15-dependent innate immunity via deconjugating protease activity. We found that two unrelated families of RNA viruses express OTU domain-containing proteases with the capacity to decrease Ub and ISG15 conjugation. Nairoviruses are negative-sense, segmented, RNA viruses of the Bunyaviridae family. Their large (L) protein contains an OTU domain and an RNA polymerase domain, placing this protein in the growing category of multifunctional viral proteins. Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a human nairovirus that causes hemorrhagic fever with up to 30% mortality (Whitehouse, 2004) . Arteriviruses, including equine arteritis virus (EAV) and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV), are the causative agents of important diseases in horses and pigs. They are positive-sense, nonsegmented RNA viruses that contain an OTU domain within their nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2), which is also involved in viral replicase polyprotein processing (Snijder et al., 1995) . We found that these viral OTU domains, in contrast to known mammalian OTU proteases, display a broad deconjugating activity toward ubiquitinated and ISGylated products and consequently inhibit innate immunity pathways that are dependent on Ub and ISG15. Thus, the deconjugating activity of viral OTU domains represents a unique strategy used by nairoviruses and arteriviruses to evade the host antiviral response, probably by targeting a common biochemical structure in Ub and the UBL protein ISG15.\\n\\nOTU Domains in Viral and Mammalian Proteins\\n\\nSequencing of the L gene of the highly pathogenic human virus CCHFV (NFS and AGS, data not shown) (Honig et al., 2004; Kinsella et al., 2004) led to the identification of an OTU domain in the N-terminal region of the viral protein ( Figure 1 ). This domain was also present in the L proteins of the nairoviruses Dugbe virus (DUGV) and Nairobi sheep disease virus (Honig et al., 2004) but has not been found in the L proteins of any other genus in the Bunyaviridae Multiple alignment of the OTU domains present in the proteins used in this study. In the consensus (Makarova et al., 2000) , ''h'' indicates hydrophobic residues (A, C, F, L, I, M, V, W, Y, T, S, G), ''s'' indicates small residues (A, C, S, T, D, V, G, P), ''+'' indicates positively charged residues (R, K), ''a'' indicates aromatic residues (W, Y, F, H), and ''t'' indicates residues with high b-turn-forming propensity (A, C, S, T, D, E, N, V, G, P). Highly conserved residues are shaded in black. Numbers at the beginning and end of each sequence indicate the positions of the first and last aligned residue in the respective protein sequences; the numbers between aligned blocks indicate the numbers of residues that are not shown. CCHFV, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus; DUGV, Dugbe virus; EAV, equine arteritis virus; PRRSV, porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus; VCIP, VCIP135; Cez, Cezanne; OTUB1 and OTUB2, Otubains 1 and 2, respectively.family. An alignment of the OTU domains present in nairoviruses, arteriviruses, and mammalian proteins A20, Cezanne, VCIP135, Otubain 1, and Otubain 2 revealed limited identity; however, a strong conservation of D 37 , G 38 , N 39 , C 40 , W 71 , H 151 , and an aromatic amino acid at position 152 (numbering based on the CCHFV-L sequence) was observed ( Figure 1 , black boxes). Among these amino acids, C 40 and H 151 (Figure 1 , black arrows) were predicted to be the catalytic residues present in the putative protease active site (Balakirev et al., 2003; Makarova et al., 2000; Nanao et al., 2004; Snijder et al., 1995) .\\n\\nImpact of CCHFV-L Expression on Protein Ubiquitination and ISGylation\\n\\nGiven that host OTU domain proteins have deubiquitinating activity (Nijman et al., 2005) , we tested the hypothesis that the L protein of CCHFV (CCHFV-L) has deubiquitinating and deISGylating activity ( Figure 2 ). Transfection of cells with plasmids expressing CCHFV-L slightly decreased the overall expression of Ub-conjugated proteins ( Figure 2B , lanes 1 and 2, panel A; Figure 2C , lanes 1, 4, and 5, panel A). To test the effect of CCHFV-L expression on protein ISGylation, ISG15 conjugates were generated by transfecting plasmids expressing ISG15 and its specific E1 (UBE1L) (Yuan and Krug, 2001) and E2 (UbcM8) (Kim et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2004) enzymes, since endogenous levels of ISGylated proteins are low in the absence of IFN stimulation. Cotransfection of CCHFV-L resulted in a clear decrease in the level of ISGylated proteins ( Figure 2B , lanes 1 and 2, panel B; Figure 2C , lanes 1, 4, and 5, panel B). This decrease was also observed when CCHFV-L was untagged (data not shown). The decrease in total ISGylation was comparable to the effect of UBP43, a known ISG15 deconjugating enzyme ( Figure 2B , lane 9, panel B). Expression of CCHFV-L did not affect levels of expression of UBE1L or UbcM8 ( Figure 2B , lane 2, panels C and D; Figure 2C , lanes 4 and 5, panel C), consistent with CCHFV-L acting via inhibition of ubiquitination and ISGylation reactions or by directly deubiquitinating or deISGylating proteins.\\n\\nThe OTU Domain of CCHFV-L Decreases the Levels of Ubiquitinated and ISGylated Proteins\\n\\nTo determine the region of the L protein responsible for decreasing ubiquitinated and ISGylated proteins, plasmids expressing three portions of the L protein were constructed ( Figure 2C , lanes 3, 6, and 7, panels A and B), strongly suggesting that the OTU domain contains a cysteine protease activity that mediates the decrease in ubiquitinated and IS-Gylated proteins.\\n\\nThe OTU Domain of CCHFV-L Is a Deconjugating Enzyme with Specificity for Poly-Ub Conjugates and ISG15\\n\\nTo determine whether the CCHFV-L OTU domain directly deconjugates Ub and ISG15 from target proteins, we expressed and purified L(1-169) and a catalytic C 40 to A 40 mutant, L(1-169)1A, for in vitro deconjugation assays (Figure 3A) . Recombinant L(1-169) cleaved both K 48 -and K 63linked poly-Ub chains into monomers ( Figure 3B , lanes 2 to 5), similarly to isopeptidase T, a known DUB enzyme ( Figure 3B , lane 10). This activity was markedly decreased by mutating the amino acid C 40 ( Figure 3B , lanes 6 to 9), indicating that this residue is required for optimal protease activity. The small amount of deconjugation observed with L(1-169)1A is not unexpected, as mutation of Cezanne's catalytic cysteine yielded similar data where most, but not all, catalytic activity was impaired (Evans et al., 2003) . This result shows that the OTU domain of CCHFV-L has bona fide DUB activity in the absence of other cellular proteins.We next determined whether L(1-169) can deconjugate ISGylated proteins. For this, we generated cell lysates from IFNb-treated Ubp43 \\u00c0/\\u00c0 murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that are rich in ISG15 conjugates (Malakhov et al., 2003) . Incubation of these lysates with recombinant L(1-169) protein, but not L(1-169)1A, appreciably decreased ISGylated proteins ( Figure 3C , top panel) in a L(1-169) concentration-dependent manner. This result suggests that the CCHFV OTU domain has C 40 -dependent ISG15 deconjugating activity but does not exclude the possibility that the protease activity of the viral OTU domain was activating another deISGylating enzyme present in cell lysates. To address this possibility, we enriched 6xHisISG15 conjugates using affinity chromatography. Incubation of ISG15 conjugates with increasing amounts of L(1-169) resulted in ISG15 deconjugation ( Figure 3C , lanes 2 to 5, bottom panel). No deconjugation was detected with the mutant L(1-169)1A protein ( Figure 3C , lanes 6 to 9, bottom panel). In addition, L(1-169) processed a pro-ISG15 protein into its mature form ( Figure 3E , lane 2, panel A). These data suggest that the CCHFV-L OTU domain directly deconjugates IS-Gylated proteins through its predicted cysteine protease activity.To gain further insights on the specificity of the OTU domain, we assessed the ability of L(1-169) and L(1-169)1A to hydrolyze poly-SUMO-2 ( Figure 3D In summary, the OTU domain of CCHFV-L hydrolyzes Ub and ISG15, but not SUMO-2 or SUMO-3, from conjugates in vitro, suggesting that viral OTU domains have the unique ability to recognize Ub and specific UBL molecules.\\n\\nAdditional Viral OTU Domains Mediate Deubiquitination and DeISGylation\\n\\nIn addition to CCHFV, viral OTU domains are found in the L proteins of other nairoviruses and in the nsp2 proteins of arteriviruses such as EAV and PRRSV (Figure 1 ). The arterivirus nsp2 cysteine protease cleaves the nsp2/nsp3 site within the large viral polyprotein during replicase maturation. In the case of EAV, this process is known to be mediated by the 166 N-terminal residues of nsp2, which contains the OTU domain (Snijder et al., 1995) . In our study, a slightly larger N-terminal EAV-nsp2 domain (175 amino acids; nsp2N) was used in addition to the fulllength protein. The OTU domain of the L protein of DUGV, a nairovirus related to CCHFV, as well as EAV-nsp2, EAV-nsp2N, and PRRSV-nsp2, decreased Ub and ISG15 conjugates when expressed in 293T cells ( Figure 4A , lanes 3-6), indicating that deconjugation may be an immune evasion strategy shared by diverse viral families.Previous studies have demonstrated that the OTU domain-containing mammalian proteins Otubain 1, Otubain 2, Cezanne, VCIP135, and A20 cleave poly-Ub chains in vitro (Balakirev et al., 2003; Evans et al., 2003 Evans et al., , 2004 Wang et al., 2004) . In contrast, only overexpression of Otubain 1 and Cezanne moderately decreased cellular global Ub conjugate levels, while expression of A20 or Otubain 2 had no effect on total levels of ubiquitinated proteins (Balakirev et al., 2003; Evans et al., 2003 Evans et al., , 2004 . To date, there have been no published studies investigating the effects of these proteins on ISG15 conjugates. We therefore tested Otubain 1, Otubain 2, Cezanne, VCIP135, and A20 for their ability to decrease overall protein ubiquitination and ISGylation in transfected cells ( Figure 4B ). Expression of Otubain 1 resulted in a significant decrease in Ub conjugate levels, while Otubain 2 and Cezanne had a lesser effect ( Figure 4B , lanes 2-4, panel 1). Consistent with their specificity for particular ubiquitinated substrates, expression of VCIP135 and A20 did not result in a decrease in overall ubiquitination. None of the OTU-containing mammalian proteins tested decreased global levels of ISG15 conjugates ( Figure 4B, lanes 2-6, panel 2) . Similar results were obtained when truncation mutants expressing the OTU domains of Otubain 1, Otubain 2, Cezanne, and A20 were tested (data not shown). In addition, the OTUcontaining catalytic domain of A20 (A20 CD ) was unable to process either ISG15 or Nedd8 ( Figure 3E , lane 4, panels A and B), even though it cleaved K 48 -linked Ub chains ( Figure 3F, lane 4) . By contrast, overexpression of the mammalian deISGylating enzyme UBP43 decreased overall levels of ISG15 conjugates but not Ub conjugates ( Figure 4B, lane 7) . Thus, viral OTU proteases appear to be unique in their ability to target both ISG15 and Ub conjugates.\\n\\nTransgenic Mice Expressing CCHFV-L(1-1325) Have Increased Susceptibility to Sindbis Virus Infection\\n\\nTo assess the effect of expressing an OTU domain during viral infection, we generated transgenic mice expressing the CCHFV-L(1-1325) OTU domain-containing protein, which exhibits DUB and deISGylating activities ( Figure 2B, lane 3) . We obtained germline transgene transmission in three lines designated 1836, 1854, and 2929, and we evaluated L(1-1325) expression in both MEFs and brain lysates from these transgenic lines. MEF cells and brain tissue from 1836 transgenic mice contained detectable L(1-1325) protein, while protein expression from the 1854 and 2929 lines was either undetectable or very low (Figures 5A and 5B) . We next evaluated the sensitivity of L(1-1325) transgenic mice to infection with the virulent Sindbis virus strain AR86, an alphavirus that causes lethal encephalitis in young mice and is sensitive to ISG15-mediated antiviral effects . Susceptibility to Sindbis virus infection tracked with expression of the L(1-1325) protein ( Figure 5C ). Thirty-five percent of mice from the 1836 transgenic line survived infection compared to R80% survival in C57/BL6 littermate controls or transgenic mice expressing low or undetectable levels of transgene-encoded protein. The decreased survival of line 1836 transgenic mice following AR86 infection suggests that CCHFV-L OTU enhances susceptibility to viral disease in vivo.\\n\\nThe OTU Domain of CCHFV Overcomes ISG15-Mediated Protection from Sindbis Virus-Induced Lethality\\n\\nThe increased pathogenicity of Sindbis virus observed in L(1-1325)-expressing mice suggested that the CCHFV-L OTU domain might counteract the antiviral activities of ISG15 in vivo. It was previously shown that expression of ISG15 from the chimeric Sindbis virus dsTE12Q protects adult IFNabR \\u00c0/\\u00c0 mice from Sindbis virus-induced lethality . To determine whether expression of the CCHFV-L OTU domain would antagonize this protective effect of ISG15, we engineered four recombinant chimeric Sindbis viruses ( Figure 6A ). Two viruses expressed ISG15 followed by an IRES element to drive translation of either L(1-169) (169GG) or enzymatically inactive L(1-169)2A (MTGG). We also generated control viruses that expressed either L(1-169) (169) or L(1-169)2A (MT) in the absence of ISG15.The recombinant viruses expressed the OTU domains and ISG15 as expected (Figures S1A and S1B in the Supplemental Data available with this article online) as well as similar levels of Sindbis virus proteins in infected cells ( Figure S1C ). All four viruses grew with similar kinetics to similar final titers under single-step growth conditions in BHK-21 cells ( Figure S2 ). This is expected, as to date ISG15 has only demonstrated antiviral activity in vivo.We assessed the ability of the L(1-169) protein expressed from within the Sindbis virus genome to deISGylate and deubiquitinate proteins by infecting BHK-21 cells ( Figure 6B ). Infection with 169GG or 169, but not MTGG or MT, reduced the amount of Ub conjugates detected in cells ( Figure 6B , right panel), indicating that the viral OTU domain functions as a DUB enzyme when expressed from a Sindbis virus. Following transfection with ISG15 and its E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, ISGylated proteins can be detected in BHK-21 cells ( Figure 6B , lane 1, middle panel). Infection with 169GG or 169 greatly reduced ISG15 conjugates, confirming that OTU expression results in deconjugation of ISGylated proteins. When cells were transfected with the E1, E2, and E3 enzymes but not ISG15, ISG15 conjugates were observed only following MTGG infection ( Figure 6B , left panel). This shows that ISG15 expressed from dsTE12Q is capable of ISGylating proteins in the presence of the relevant conjugating enzymes but that this is only seen in the presence of a catalytically inactive form of the coexpressed L(1-169) protein ( Figure 6B, lane 3, left panel) .We then determined whether OTU expression could counter ISG15's in vivo antiviral effect. In order to exclude effects due to IFNab-stimulated genes other than ISG15, we infected IFNabR \\u00c0/\\u00c0 mice ( Figure 6C ). Seventy percent of mice infected with a virus expressing ISG15 and the mutant OTU domain (MTGG) survived, consistent with previous observations that expression of ISG15 protects mice from lethality following Sindbis virus infection . In contrast, only 20% of mice infected with a virus expressing ISG15 and a functional OTU domain (169GG) survived infection (p = 0.0015). These data also correlate with our in vitro data demonstrating that L(1-169), but not L(1-169)2A, can deISGylate proteins following infection ( Figure 6B ). Mice infected with 169 or MT died with similar kinetics, demonstrating that the expression of L(1-169) did not increase the virulence of dsTE12Q in the absence of the IFN-mediated antiviral response. The slight increase in survival between 169GG and 169 (p < 0.0001) or MT (p = 0.0032) suggests that expression of the CCHFV OTU domain cannot completely antagonize the effects of ISG15 in this system. Nevertheless, these data show that expression of a catalytically active viral OTU domain can antagonize the antiviral effects of ISG15 in vivo.\\n\\nNegative Regulation of the NF-kB Pathway by Viral OTU Domains\\n\\nWhile the data above indicate that a viral OTU domain protease can counter the antiviral activities of ISG15, they do not address the possibility that the DUB activity of these proteins might also play a role in immune evasion. To address this hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of the CCHFV-L and EAV-nsp2 OTU domains on the NF-kB signaling pathway. Expression of the OTU domains of CCHFV-L and of EAV-nsp2 decreased in a dose-dependent manner the activation of an NF-kBresponsive promoter (Fujita et al., 1992) after TNFa treatment. This inhibition was similar to that mediated by A20, an OTU domain-containing inhibitor of the NF-kB pathway ( Figure 7A) . Inhibition was about 10-fold greater in the presence of the L(1-169) domain than the L(1-169)2A mutant, indicating a role for the OTU domain protease activity. These results were further confirmed by the ability of CCHFV-L(1-169) to inhibit NF-kB activation as measured by the inhibition of endogenous p65 nuclear translocation upon TNFa treatment ( Figures 7B and 7C) . The slight inhibition of NF-kB activation by the L(1-169)2A protein could be caused by some residual binding of this mutant to ubiquitinated substrates or by the presence of some other regulatory motifs within this protein. Nevertheless, the p65 nuclear translocation inhibition by the L(1-169) protein was significantly higher when compared to its mutant counterpart (p = 0.0044). Overall, these results demonstrate the ability of viral OTU domains to affect immune pathways that are regulated by ubiquitination.\\n\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\nHere we show that viral OTU domain-containing proteins are proteases that hydrolyze Ub and ISG15 from conjugated proteins. This dual deconjugating activity provide an elegant example of the economy of viral evolution, since both Ub and ISG15 rely on a conserved conjugation motif. Furthermore, the protease activity by the viral OTU domains has the physiologic capacity to evade two different cytokine pathways, IFNab and TNFa, that are fundamentally important for antiviral immunity. \\n\\nViral DUB and DeISGylating Enzymes: A Unique Strategy for Immune Evasion?\\n\\nBiochemical and genetic evidence supports the concept that protein ubiquitination plays a critical role in the induction of both the innate and the adaptive cellular immune system (Liu et al., 2005) . For example, in addition to NF-kB signaling, Ub regulates several aspects of antiviral immunity, such as MHC class I and II antigen presentation (Loureiro and Ploegh, 2006; Shin et al., 2006) , TLR/IL1 signaling (Chen, 2005) , and induction of type I IFN by the cellular viral sensor RIGI (Gack et al., 2007) . Inhibition of protein ubiquitination might also affect other cellular processes that can be subverted by viruses for their own advantage, such as the proteasome-mediated protein degradation system, multiple signal transduction events, or cell cycle progression. Given the effects that we observed on NF-kB signaling, it seems likely that viral OTU domain-containing proteases may be able to target these and other Ub-dependent pathways.While the biochemical effects of ISGylation have been studied far less extensively than those of Ub, ISG15 is an important antiviral protein (Lenschow et al., , 2007 Okumura et al., 2006) . Thus, it is not surprising that viruses may use multiple strategies to counter the antiviral effects of ISG15. The work presented here provides a viral strategy for decreasing expression of bona fide ISG15 conjugates in cells. The first such strategy reported is the direct association of the NS1 protein of influenza B virus with ISG15. This association inhibits protein ISGylation by blocking the ISG15-UBE1L interaction ( and Krug, 2001) , while the viral OTU domain proteases analyzed here accomplish a similar effect via deconjugation.The Ub and ISG15 deconjugation activities by the viral OTU domains contrast with the specific Ub deconjugation activity by the OTU domain-containing cellular proteins tested in this study. We speculate that other viral proteases, perhaps including some that do not have OTU domains, will be found to target both Ub-and ISG15-dependent processes. To date, viral DUB activities and in vitro cleavage of ISG15 fusion proteins have been demonstrated for the adenoviral protease adenain (Balakirev et al., 2002) and the papain-like proteases from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) ( Barretto et al., 2005; Lindner et al., 2005; Ratia et al., 2006) .\\n\\nOTU Domain Specificity and Deconjugating Activity, a Target for Antiviral Drug Development?\\n\\nWe found that the CCHFV-L OTU domain processed Ub and ISG15 conjugates and pro-ISG15 and pro-Nedd8 in vitro but did not have activity against any SUMO isoforms. Ub, ISG15, and Nedd8 differ from SUMO in their exposed C-terminal motifs: LRLRGG for Ub and ISG15 and LALRGG for Nedd8 versus QQQTGG for SUMO-2 and SUMO-3. This raises the interesting possibility that sequences similar to the LRLRGG motif may play an important role in substrate recognition and specific cleavage by CCHFV-L OTU and perhaps other viral proteases. Interestingly, the nsp2 of arteriviruses cleaves the nsp2/3 junction at FRLIGG (EAV) or GRLLGG (PRSSV) (Allende et al., 1999; Snijder et al., 1996; Ziebuhr et al., 2000) , sequences similar to the LRLRGG motif. Thus, arterivirus OTU proteases have dual functions: performing essential viral polyprotein processing and targeting host substrates to modulate the antiviral response. This is analogous to the hepatitis C virus NS3-4A protease, which is involved both in viral polyprotein processing and in cleaving the cellular antiviral proteins TRIF and IPS-1 Lin et al., 2006) .The characterization of the CCHFV-L OTU domain and the development of in vitro assays for its enzymatic activities as described in this study will make it feasible to screen for potential inhibitors specific for CCHFV-L and other OTU domain-containing viral proteins. High-throughput screening of chemical compound libraries has proven to be a valuable tool in the identification of small-molecule inhibitors of other viral proteases such as HCV-NS3-4A (Sudo et al., 2005) and SARS-3CLpro (Blanchard et al., 2004) . Since the viral OTU domains have a unique capacity to target both Ub and ISG15 conjugates, the design of specific inhibitors might be possible. For this reason, structural studies will be of great value to understand both the molecular basis of the unique biochemical activities of these viral proteins and the potential for development of antiviral compounds.Physiologic Importance of Viral OTU Domain Protease DUB and DeISGylating Activities Our demonstration that viral OTU domain-containing proteases can decrease both Ub and ISG15 conjugates in cells does not alone constitute proof that protease activity directed toward these substrates plays a role in viral infection. We were limited in performing the obvious experiment of assessing the role of viral OTU domain protease activity during infection by two things. First, CCHFV is a biosafety level 4 pathogen lacking a good animal model and whose molecular biology is not well enough developed to allow generation of mutant viruses. Second, the viral OTU domain proteases evaluated here either have, or are likely to have, important effects on processing of viral polyproteins (see above). Given this, we felt that it would be difficult to prove that these proteases have effects during infection that are solely attributable to their DUB and deISGylating activities. However, in transgenic mice, recombinant chimeric Sindbis viruses, and transfected cells, we found that viral OTU domain-containing proteases have significant effects on Ub-and ISG15-dependent host processes of known importance for innate immunity. We therefore conclude that these proteins have bona fide immune evasion properties. It will be interesting to further investigate the activities of these and other viral proteases that target Ub-and ISG15-dependent processes during viral infection.\\n\\nExpression Plasmids\\n\\nPlasmids pCAGGS-6HismISG15, pCAGGS-hUBE1L-HA, pFLAGCMV2-UbcM8, and pcDNA3.1-UbcM8 were provided by Dong-Er Zhang (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) .

Twenty-four hours posttransfection, the cells were lysed in Laemmli sample, boiled, and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody. Each transfection experiment was performed a minimum of three times.\\n\\nGeneration of ISG15 Conjugates\\n\\nFourteen 10 cm dishes of 293T cells were transfected with 6 mg pCAGGS-6HismISG15, 3 mg pCAGGS-hUBE1L-HA, and 3 mg pFLAGCMV2-UbcM8. Twenty-four hours later, cells were harvested, resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) with 300 mM NaCl, and lysed by three cycles of freeze-thaw. Lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm. His-tagged ISG15 conjugates were purified over a His-Select Spin Column (SIGMA) following the manufacturer's directions. Column-bound conjugates were washed extensively with washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 300 mM NaCl, and 5 mM Imidazole) and eluted with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, and 250 mM Imidazole. Protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad).In Vitro Deconjugation Assays K 48 Ub 2-7 , K 63 Ub 3-7 , SUMO-2 2-8 , SUMO-3 2-8 , pro-ISG15, pro-Nedd8, pro-SUMO-1, USP5/Isopeptidase T, NEDP1, UBP43, A20 CD , and His6-SENP2 CD were purchased from Boston Biochem (Cambridge, MA). All reactions were performed in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM DTT at 37 C for 2 hr. Serial 10-fold dilutions of L(1-169) or L(1-169)1A (ranging from 2.5 mM to 2.5 nM) were incubated with either 2.5 mg Ub chains or SUMO chains; 2.5 mg pro-ISG15, pro-Nedd8, or pro-SUMO-1; 10 ml Ubp43 \\u00c0/\\u00c0 lysate; or 3 mg of 6HisISG15 conjugates. Positive control for deconjugation was incubation with 100 mM USP5 (Ub), SENP2 CD (SUMO), NEDP1 (Nedd8), or UBP43 (ISG15). Negative control was incubation of chains or conjugates in assay buffer alone. Reactions were terminated by addition of Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis on a 4%-20% gradient gel (BioRad). Proteins were visualized by SimplyBlue Safestain (Invitrogen) staining (Ub and SUMO) or by anti-ISG15 western blot.\\n\\nViruses\\n\\nSindbis viruses were generated from a cDNA clone by in vitro transcription and RNA transfection of BHK-21 cells as previously described (Levine et al., 1996; Lenschow et al., 2005) . Recombinant virus stocks were produced and titered on BHK-21 cells as previously described . Sindbis virus AR86 was a kind gift of Dr. Mark Heise (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) (Heise et al., 2000) .\\n\\nNF-kB Reporter Gene Assay\\n\\n293T cells were cotransfected with 3.3-fold dilutions (starting at 100 ng) of A20, CCHFV-L(1-169), CCHFV-L(1-169)2A, EAV-nsp2N, or empty plasmid along with the firefly luciferase gene construct under the control of the NF-kB-binding sites) (Wang et al., 2000) and pRL-TK (Renilla luciferase; Promega, WI). The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding the pCAGGS empty vector. Twenty-four hours posttransfection, the cells were stimulated with TNFa (10 ng/ml) for 6 hr, and luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter (DLR) Assay System (Promega). Final NF-kB luciferase values were normalized with the Renilla luciferase values as internal control.\\n\\nImmunofluorescence\\n\\nTwo hundred nanograms of empty plasmid or Flag-tagged L(1-169) and L(1-169)2A were transfected into A549 cells. Twenty-four hours later, cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNFa for 2 hr. Cells were fixed and permeabilized for 30 min at room temperature with 2.5% formaldehyde and 0.5% Triton X-100, washed extensively with PBS, and stained with anti-p65 and anti-Flag antibodies. Following PBS washes, cells were stained with anti-mouse (p65) or anti-rabbit (Flag) and secondary antibodies, and then mounted in medium containing an antifade reagent. Nuclear localization of p65 was scored in 100 to 400 transfected cells for each experimental condition.\\n\\nMouse Studies\\n\\nIFNabR \\u00c0/\\u00c0 mice on the 129/SV/Pas background were initially obtained from M. Aguet, Swiss Institute of Experimental Cancer Research (Epalinges, Switzerland) (Behr et al., 2001; Dunn et al., 2005) . CCHFV-L(1-1325) transgenic mice were generated at the WUSM Pathology Microinjection Core by microinjecting a linearized construct derived from pCAGGS-HA-L(1-1325) into B6 oocytes. Oocytes were implanted into pseudopregnant mice, and resulting litters were genotyped using PCR (primer sequences available upon request). Individual embryo MEFs from transgenic lines 1836, 1854, and 2929 were generated as described previously (Weck et al., 1999) . Uninfected transgenic brain was homogenized in 1 ml of DMEM with protease inhibitors using 100 ml 1.0 mm diameter zirconia-silica beads in a MagNa Lyser (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). To assess transgene expression, 4 3 10 5 MEFs or 12 ml of brain homogenate were immunoblotted with HA.11 and anti-actin antibodies. Eight-to ten-week-old male IFNabR \\u00c0/\\u00c0 mice were infected subcutaneously (s.c.) in the left hind footpad with 5 3 10 6 PFU of virus diluted in 50 ml of Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS). Four-to fiveweek old L(1-1325) transgenic mice were infected s.c. in the left hind footpad with 5000 PFU of Sindbis virus AR86 diluted in 50 ml of HBSS. Mice were bred and maintained at Washington University School of Medicine in accordance with all federal and university guidelines.\\n\\nStatistical Analysis\\n\\nAll data were analyzed with Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).

Single-step growth curves were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).\\n\\nSupplemental Data\\n\\nThe Supplemental Data include Supplemental Experimental Procedures and two supplemental figures and can be found with this article online at http://www.cellhostandmicrobe.com/cgi/content/full/2/6/ 404/DC1/.\\n\\n\",\n          \"Introduction\\n\\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus named as SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which led to thousands of infected patients and hundreds of deaths [1] [2] [3] . To date, there is no effective drug to prevent or treat SARS. In addition, there is possibility of reintroduction of a SARS-like coronavirus into humans and the risk of an escape of SARS-CoV from laboratories [4, 5] . Although the outbreaks seem to be over, SARS remains safety concerns [6, 7] . SARS-CoV has been isolated and its genome sequenced [8, 9] . SARS-CoV is a positive-sense RNA virus that consists of four main structural proteins: spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E) and nucleocapsid protein (N). S protein is a major structural glycoprotein of SARS-CoV responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion [10] . It has been reported that vaccines based on the S protein seem to provide protection via an inhibition of viral replication after challenge with live SARS-CoV [11] . In addition, the cell-mediated response induced by S protein also plays a very important role in eliminating virus. We have demonstrated previously that after immunization with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine, cellular immunity was induced by the evidence of high frequencies of IFN-\\u2425 producing effector/memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in mice [12] . Hence, S protein is a major target for developing anti-SARS drugs or vaccines.Evidence suggests that cytotoxic CD8 + T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a pivotal role in the elimination of virus particles during infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) acute infection [13, 14] . And to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, CTLs not only contribute to virus elimination, but also induce immunopathology [15, 16] . Excited to us, we found that SARS-CoV S specific CTL responses were detected in patients who had recovered from SARS and mouse model [17, 18] . Therefore, CTLs may determine the role of immunity in controlling viral pathogenesis. Human CTLs are specific for peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. HLA-A*0201 is expressed as 39-46% of all major ethnicities [19] , and furthermore HLA class I alleles have been reported to correlate with SARS susceptibility [20] . Recently, five S protein-derived CTL epitopes S1042-1050, S787-795, S1167-1175, S958-966 and S411-420 were identified by some groups [21] [22] [23] [24] . They have screened HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides which may be appropriate vaccine candidates. However, phenotypic characteristics and functions of the CTLs induced by those HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides remain undefined, and their distributions in different organs are still unknown. In this study, the CD8 + T cell responses induced by HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides were evaluated in draining lymph nodes, spleens and lungs from HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice vaccinated by SARS-CoV S DNA prime and HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides boost strategy. The functionalities and characteristics of the cognate peptides induced CD8 + T cell response were analyzed. Our data confirmed previous reports and demonstrated that numerous powerful peptide-specific CD8 + T cells that represented a memory subset with CD45RB high and CD62L low were elicited by HLA-A*0201-restricted peptides both in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. These peptide-specific CD8 + T cells were persisted for over a long period of time, suggesting their long-term protective effect in vivo. These data provide novel information of antigen-specific CD8 + T cell responses in detail, which could be used for design of effective vaccine against SARS-CoV infection in humans.\\n\\nMice\\n\\nHLA-A*0201/K b transgenic (Tg) mice were a gift from Prof. Y.Z. Wu (Institute of Immunology, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China). Tg mice were bred in a pathogen-free facility. Cell surface HLA-A*0201 expression was assessed by flow cytometry using FITC-labeled anti-human HLA-A2 Ab (BD Biosciences PharMingen). For experimental purposes, six-eightweek-old female mice were used. All experiments were performed according to the guidelines in the Institutional Animal Committee of TMMU.\\n\\nSARS-CoV S DNA vaccine\\n\\nPlasmids encoding SARS-CoV S protein were constructed as described [25] and kindly provided by Dr. Gary J. Nabel from Vaccine Research Center (VRC), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD, USA. Plasmid DNA was purified by plasmid purified kit (QIAGEN, USA). The 260/280 ratios ranged from 1.8 to 2.0. The endotoxin content from purified plasmid DNA was detected below 20 U/ml. The endotoxin level within this range had no effect on the immune response.\\n\\nPrediction of epitopes and synthesis of peptides\\n\\nSequences of potential HLA-A*0201-binding peptides within SARS-CoV S proteins were based on the BJ01 strain of SARS-CoV (GenBank accession no. AY278488). We combined two computer algorithms. The first computer-based program was applied with access through the website of Bioinformatics and Molecular Analysis Section (BIMAS) HLA Peptide Binding Predictions [26] . The second algorithm \\\"SYFPEITHI\\\" was developed by Rammensee et al. [27] . Besides, according to the information that several published articles have been reported [21] [22] [23] [24] , we screened and synthesized five peptides named as P19 (S1042-1050 VVFLHV-TYV), P20 (S787-795 ILPDPLKPT), P21 (S1167-1175 RLNEVAKNL), P22 (S958-966 VLNDILSRL) and P23 (S411-420 KLPDDFMGCV) by Sangon Crop. (Shanghai, China). Peptides were purified to >98% by reverse phase HPLC, as confirmed by mass spectrometry, which were dissolved in PBS at 2 mg/ml and stored in aliquots at \\u221280 \\u2022 C.\\n\\nImmunization\\n\\nHLA-A*0201/K b Tg mice are a well-established model for the study of HLA-A*0201 restricted CTL epitopes and vaccine development [28] [29] [30] . Mice were injected intramuscularly with 100 g truncated SARS CoV S plasmid DNA in 100 l PBS in thighs. Two weeks later, mice were boosted by subcutaneous injection of HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides (P19-23, 20 g of each) with 25 g CpG ODN 1826 (Sangon Crop., Shanghai, China) as adjuvant at the base of tail. PBS was administrated alone as control. Each experiment was repeated 2-3 times with consistent results and 3-12 mice were used in each experiment.\\n\\nMedia and antibodies\\n\\nRPMI-1640 media was purchased from GIBCO and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 0.1% 2-ME, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin. Purified anti-mouse CD28, anti-CD8-FITC, anti-CD8-PE, anti-CD4-PerCP, anti-IFN-\\u2425-APC, anti-IFN-\\u2425-PE, anti-IL-2-PE, anti-TNF-\\u2423-APC, anti-CD107a/b-FITC, anti-CD62L-FITC, anti-CD45RB-FITC and isotype control Abs were purchased from BD Biosciences PharMingen. RmIL-4 and recombinant murine GM-CSF was obtained from R&D and PEPROTECH, Inc. (USA) respectively. LPS was provided by Sigma (USA).\\n\\nCell culture and measurement of cytokine by ELISA\\n\\nMice were sacrificed. Lymph nodes, spleens and lungs from individual mouse were harvested 7-10 d after the boost vaccination. Single-cell suspensions were prepared. Bone marrow derived DCs were generated from Tg mice as previously described with some modification [31] . DCs were pulsed with pool peptides P19-23 (2 g/ml each peptide) at 37 \\u2022 C for 5 h before co-cultured with lymphocytes. Lymphocyte suspensions from lymph nodes, spleens and lungs were plated respectively in a 96-well micro-titer plate at 4 \\u00d7 10 6 cells/200 l per well in the presence of 2 \\u00d7 10 5 peptideloaded DCs. Supernatants of cell cultures were collected 16 and 72 h later, and levels of IL-2, TNF-\\u2423 and IFN-\\u2425 were assessed respectively by specific ELISA kit (BD PharMingen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.\\n\\nELISPOT assay\\n\\nAssay was performed using mouse ELISPOT set (BD PharMingen) according to the instruction provided by the manufacture. Briefly, single-cell suspensions from vaccinated mice were prepared and plated in 96 well micro-plates (Millipore) pre-coated with anti-IFN-\\u2425 antibody overnight at 4 \\u2022 C and blocked by RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS. Cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of peptide-loaded DCs at 37 \\u2022 C and 5% CO 2 . Wells were washed and incubated with biotinylated labeled anti-mouse IFN-\\u2425 antibody for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, wells were incubated with streptavidin conjugated horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. Wells were extensively washed again, and developed with 3-amino-9-ethyl-carbazole (AEC) substrate solutions. After drying, wells were counted by TCL ELISPOT reader (USA).\\n\\nIntracellular cytokine and cell surface staining\\n\\nSingle-cell suspensions from lymph nodes, spleens and lungs of vaccinated mice were co-cultured with or without peptide-loaded DCs for 6 h at 37 \\u2022 C and 5% CO 2 . Brefeldin A (10 g/ml, Sigma) was added in the last 5 h incubation. Cells were washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in PBS buffer containing 0.1% saponin (Sigma), 0.1% BSA and 0.05% NaN 3 overnight at 4 \\u2022 C. Then cells were stained with conjugated mAbs for surface markers (CD4, CD8, CD62L, CD107a/b and CD45RB) and intracellular cytokines (IFN-\\u2425, IL-2 and TNF-\\u2423) for 20 min at 4 \\u2022 C in dark. Cells were acquired on flow cytometer (BD Calibur) and data were analyzed with the program FlowJo version 6.0 (Tree Star, Inc., USA). Isotype controls were included in each staining.\\n\\nStatistics\\n\\nStatistical evaluation of differences between means of experimental groups was performed by analysis of variance and a non-parametric two-tailed t test. A value of P < 0.05 was considered to be significant.\\n\\nCellular immune responses were elicited by HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues of immunized Tg mice\\n\\nTo assess the production of cytokines by lymphocytes of Tg mice following SARS-CoV S DNA prime and HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides boost vaccination, HLA-A*0201/K b Tg mice were randomly divided into three groups to be immunized with cognate DNA plus peptides, DNA alone and PBS as control respectively. 7-10 d after boost vaccination, mice were sacrificed and cells were prepared from lymph nodes, spleens and lungs. The cells were stimulated with or without peptide-loaded DCs to assess HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific immune responses. The levels of IFN-\\u2425, TNF-\\u2423 and IL-2 in the cell-free culture supernatants were determined by ELISA. The results revealed that very low levels of IFN-\\u2425 were detected when lymphocytes were cultured in medium alone. Interestingly, addition of peptide-loaded DCs to cell culture systems markedly enhanced the production of IFN-\\u2425 in all of the organs from DNA plus peptides immunized mice (Fig. 1A ). There is only modest IFN-\\u2425 production in splenocytes from DNA alone immunized mice (P < 0.01) and the levels of IFN-\\u2425 in PBS control groups were undetectable. Besides, there were TNF-\\u2423 and IL-2 produced by lymphocytes from Tg mice immunized with SARS S DNA and HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides following cognate peptide stimulation in vitro. The results showed that the highest level of TNF-\\u2423 was detected in lungs which were non-lymphoid tissues (P < 0.05). The production of IL-2 in spleens (P < 0.001) and lymph nodes (P < 0.05) was little stronger than it in lungs (Fig. 1B) . Taken together, these data indicated that striking cytokine production was induced both in lymphoid and non-lymphoid lymphocytes stimulated with HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides in Tg mice following SARS S DNA plus HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides vaccination.\\n\\nFrequency of IFN--producing cells from immunized mice following stimulation with HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides\\n\\nWe have detected the production of IFN-\\u2425 in total lymphocytes by ELISA. However, what percentages of HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific T cells have been induced in Tg mice after DNA plus peptides immunization. Thus, the frequency of IFN-\\u2425-producing cells at the single cell level was determined by ELISPOT assay. As shown in Fig. 2 , 10 d after prime immunization with SARS S DNA and boost immunization with HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides, cells from spleens produced at an average of 124 spots in 4 \\u00d7 10 5 cells following stimulation with peptide-loaded DCs. Compared with cells without any peptides stimulation, the specific cells exhibited from 20 to 66-fold increase in the frequency of IFN-\\u2425-producing cells in spleens (P < 0.05). Together, it is believed that HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides P19-23 could act as stimulators to induce a powerful peptide-specific CD8 + T cell immune response.\\n\\nIFN--producing cells belong to CD8 + T cells\\n\\nTo directly characterize the subpopulation of IFN-\\u2425-producing cells, we next analyzed the immune responses of T cell subsets induced after prime and boost immunization in Tg mice by FACS. Splenocytes were stimulated in vitro with or without peptide-loaded DCs in the presence of Brefeldin A. After stimulation for 6 h, the cell-surface markers and intracellular cytokines were stained with anti-CD8, anti-CD4, anti-IFN-\\u2425 and isotype controls. For flow cytometric analysis, a lymphocyteenriched population was initially selected from total cells by forward/side scatter gating (Fig. 3A) . Then the expression of IFN-\\u2425 in CD8 + T and CD4 + T subpopulation was analyzed respectively. HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides specific IFN-\\u2425-producing cells were detected in CD8 + T subset but not in CD4 + T cells. These results were consistent with the previous reports [21] [22] [23] [24] and identified that the peptides P19-23 were HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides. Based on IFN-\\u2425 production, the percentage of peptidespecific CD8 + T cells with peptides stimulation was markedly higher than cells cultured in medium alone (Fig. 3B) . These data suggested that P19-23 as HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides could act as stimulators to elicit a striking peptide-specific CTL response. \\n\\nCorrelation of cytokines produced by HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides specific CTLs\\n\\nEvidence has confirmed that large amounts of IFN-\\u2425-producing CTLs are induced by peptides P19-23, and furthermore we want to know what kind of other cytokines could be produced by these CTLs. To illuminate this question, splenocytes from primeboost immunized mice were stimulated in vitro with or without peptide-loaded DCs in the same way as above. The CTL related intracellular cytokines were stained with anti-IFN-\\u2425, anti-TNF-\\u2423, anti-IL-2 and isotope controls. Results showed that HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific CTLs could simultaneously produce several kinds of cytokines such as IFN-\\u2425, TNF-\\u2423 and IL-2 (Fig. 4A ). Further analysis of IFN-\\u2425 and TNF-\\u2423 expression demonstrated that peptide-specific CTLs could be divided into three distinct subpopulations, including IFN-\\u2425 + TNF-\\u2423 + cells, IFN-\\u2425 + cells and TNF-\\u2423 + cells. Most cells expressed both IFN-\\u2425 and TNF-\\u2423, and only small subsets of the cells expressed either IFN-\\u2425 or TNF-\\u2423 alone (Fig. 4A  and B ). In the same experiment, the expression of IFN-\\u2425 and IL-2 presented the same phenomenon in peptide-specific CTLs which could be separated into IFN-\\u2425 + IL-2 + double positive subset, IFN-\\u2425 + single positive and IL-2 + single positive subsets. Differently the mainly subset was composed by IFN-\\u2425 + single positive cells, only a small population of the IFN-\\u2425 + IL-2 + CD8 + T cells could be detected and very few IL-2 + CD8 + T cells were observed (Fig. 4B) . Taken together, these results indicated that HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific CTLs elicited in vivo can produce several kinds of cytokines following peptides stimulation, suggesting that the CTLs may have effective function in protecting body against infection. \\n\\nCharacterization of T cell responses following DNA prime and peptide boost immunization in Tg mice\\n\\nTo characterize the phenotype of HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific CD8 + T cells on the basis of their ability to produce IFN-\\u2425, splenocytes from prime-boost immunized Tg mice were stimulated with peptide-loaded DCs. After 6 h of incubation, cells were harvested, washed and stained for cell-surface markers, including CD45RB as a marker for memory cells in mice and CD62L as effector/memory T subset marker. Cells were first gated on CD8 + T cells and the phenotype of IFN-\\u2425 + CD8 + T cells was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 5 , nearly 89% of IFN-\\u2425 + CD8 + T cells expressed CD45RB high and approximately 84% subset was CD62L low . Although most IFN-\\u2425 producing cells were CD45RB high CD62L low cells, a variable fraction (mean value 16%) of the IFN-\\u2425 + CD8 + T cells expressed high level of CD62L which were considered as typical central memory CD8 + T cells [32, 33] . Thus, on basis of IFN-\\u2425 producing cells, a population of peptidespecific CD8 + T cells that have characteristics of memory T cells has been identified in this study. And the IFN-\\u2425 + CD8 + T cells with CD45RB high CD62L low might indeed belong to an intermediate sub- set ready to be conscripted into the effector population during reinfection.\\n\\nHLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific CD8 + T cells express cytolytic effector molecules\\n\\nWe were interested in determining whether there were a number of cytolytic effector T cells induced by HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides. As we all know, degranulation is a key step to Ag-specific CD8 + T cells to lyze targets cells. Evidence suggests that FACS assay measures the exposure of CD107a/b onto the cell surface as a result of degranulation, presenting in the membrane of cytotoxic granules [34] . We observed a reciprocal expression of surface CD107a/b which may be due to granzyme depletion in cells having undergone recent granule exocytosis. In this study, surface expression of CD107a/b was enriched in CD8 + T cells stimulated by peptides in vitro, over the population of CD8 + T cells without peptides stimulation (Fig. 6 ). In the same time the expression of IFN-\\u2425 or TNF-\\u2423 by CD8 + T cells was determined and results showed that a small part of cells co-expressed CD107a/b with IFN-\\u2425 or TNF-\\u2423, suggesting the diversity of antigen-specific T cells. Thus, a subset of CD8 + T cells expresses effector molecules associated with the cytotoxic function. We believe that these data strongly support the hypothesis that antigen-specific CD8 + T cells mediate effective cytotoxic activity in vivo.\\n\\nDistribution of peptide-specific CTLs in lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs\\n\\nTo further ascertain whether the distributions of HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific CD8 + T cells were distinct in different organs. Tg mice were immunized with SARS S DNA and peptides. 10 d after injection, peptide-specific CD8 + T cells based on IFN-\\u2425 and CD107a/b expression were determined in lymph nodes, spleens and lungs. As shown in Fig. 7 , the percentages of both IFN-\\u2425 and CD107a/b producing cells in total lymphocytes from different organs were all dramatically higher than those cultured in medium alone. And the highest frequency of antigen-specific IFN-\\u2425 expressing CD8 + T cells as well as CD107a/b producing CD8 + T cells were elicited by HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides stimulation in lungs than in lymph nodes and spleens ( Fig. 7C and D) . These results suggested that effector T cells always existed in non-lymphoid tissues and consisted with our [12] and other previous reports [35] .\\n\\nLong-lived memory CD8 + T cells were elicited by SARS S HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides\\n\\nIn previous experiments, we evaluated the peptide-specific CD8 + T cell immune responses 7-10 d after prime and boost vaccination. Here, we extended our study to further characterize SARS S HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific long-persistent memory T cell responses 30 d after the boost immunization. The data showed that persistent peptide-specific memory CD8 + T cells which could secrete IFN-\\u2425 and TNF-\\u2423 following cognate peptides stimulation still could be detected in spleens, though one month has pasted since the boost vaccination. The frequency of IFN-\\u2425 + CD8 + T (mean value 0.23%) cells and TNF-\\u2423 + CD8 + T cells (mean value 0.29%) from stimulated splenocytes were 5.6-and 5.7-folds higher than cells cultured in medium alone, respectively. Similar results were also obtained for peptide-specific CD8 + T cells co-expressing IFN-\\u2425 and TNF-\\u2423 which possessed great percentages, suggesting the strong ability of peptide-specific CD8 + T cell induced by SARS S HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides. In addition, based on IFN-\\u2425 production the phenotype of these long-lived peptide-specific CD8 + T cells were characterized with surface marker CD45 and CD62L, and the majority of IFN-\\u2425 + CD8 + T cells were CD45 high and CD62L low . These constellations of findings make us believe that these peptidespecific CD8 + T cells induced by prime-boost vaccination will be quickly conscripted into effector populations to protect body during reinfection (Fig. 8) .\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThe generation of memory CD8 + T cells is a potential strategy in design of vaccine against intracellular pathogens. It has been reported that vaccination with cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes could protect against human metapneumovirus infection in murine model [36] , suggesting that CTLs play a pivotal role in virus elimination. In this study, the properties of immune responses of CTLs which were induced by SARS S HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides in vaccinated HLA-A*0201 Tg mice were explored. We found that CTLs generated in response to SARS S DNA prime and HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides boost immunization secreted IFN-\\u2425, TNF-\\u2423 and IL-2. Furthermore, we detected that these CTLs express cell surface CD107a/b for the first time which represent the cytolytic activity of CD8 + T cells in a peptide-specific and HLA-A*0201-restricted manner. Finally, the results showed that the peptide-specific CD8 + T cells that can keep long-term survival in vivo had a memory T cell phenotype based on their low expression of CD62L and high level of CD45RB, and the distributions of them in lymphoid tissues and non-lymphoid tissues were different.Spike protein is a major structural glycoprotein of SARS-CoV. An understanding of the immunology of coronavirus infections in mice and swine indicated that, of the large number of potential vaccine antigens encoded by the SARS-CoV genome, S glycoprotein would be the best [37] . Recent work has shed light on the important role of S protein in inducing effective cellular immune responses and humoral responses both in mice [12, 25] and humans [17] .In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that prime-boost vaccination of mice with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine induced remarkable antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses in response to a pool of entire overlapping S peptides [12] . In view of the advantages of polypeptide vaccine, many teams are trying to identify SARS S epitopes to provide optimum candidates for vaccine development. We have identified two novel epitopes which could induce antigen-specific CD4 + T cell and CD8 + T cell immune responses in BABL/C mice, respectively [18] . However, it is known that the ultimate purpose of scientific research is used by human beings. Although many antigen-specific CD8 + T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV had been identified in animal models, it is not appropriated to directly apply them to the human vaccine. So identification of functional dominant CD8 + T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV S protein for human is crucial. Excited to us is that several HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides from SARS S protein have been screened by some groups currently [21] [22] [23] [24] . However, the mechanisms and properties of immune responses induced by these epitopes are still not well understood. In present study, we verified their results and determined the functions and features of peptide-specific CD8 + T cells elicited by these HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides.Consist with the pervious reports [35] which the expression of IFN-\\u2425 in lungs is higher than lymph nodes and spleens, suggesting that the effector T cells were transiently endowed with the ability to traffic to non-lymphoid organs. In addition to IFN-\\u2425, these antigenstimulated CD8 + T cells acquire antiviral effector functions, such as the ability to produce TNF-\\u2423. TNF-\\u2423 that has important effect role in activating macrophages, inducing apoptosis of infected cells and contributing to granuloma formation. IL-2 has little direct effect function but is an indicator of cells with higher capacity for survival and proliferation that can later evolve effect responses. Although peptide-specific CD8 + T cells from both lymph nodes and spleens could produce IL-2 upon peptides stimulation, the level of IL-2 in lungs was under detectable. As we know antigen-specific CD8 + T cells become exhausted by loss of a subset of effect functions and IL-2 production appears most sensitive to inactivation, followed by TNF-\\u2423 synthesis, while IFN-\\u2425 production appears more resistant to this early functional loss [33] . To say in other words, CD8 + T cells producing IL-2 are also more likely to differentiate into memory cells, and CD8 + T cells producing only IFN-\\u2425 tend to be short-lived. Thus, we presumed that antigen-activated CD8 + T cells that migrate from lymphoid tissues to lungs which belong to effect organ were short-lived, while most memory CD8 + T cells reside in the lymphoid tissues.In addition to their potential importance as cytokine-producing T cells, HLA-A* 0201 restricted peptide-specific CD8 + T cells were identified based on their ability to express CD107a/b. CD107a and CD107b are two intracellular proteins that are normally found in lysosome, but are also a structural component of cytotoxic granules. Acquisition of cell surface CD107a/b is associated with loss of intracellular perforin, indicating that exposure of CD107a/b to the cell surface is dependent on degranulation. Following exocytosis of cytotoxic granules, CD107a/b is transiently expressed on the cell surface of CTLs [38, 39] . Thus, the expression of CD107a/b can actually reflect the cytotoxic ability of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells [34] . Kamath et al. [38] have detected the level of CD107a/b in antigen-specific CD8 + T cells during mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. However, the expression of CD107a/b of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells in SARS has never been detected. Our results showed for the first time that the expression of CD107a/b in peptides stimulated lymphocytes from spleens markedly increased, suggesting the production of cytotoxic antigen-specific CD8 + T cells in vaccinated Tg mice. Meanwhile, we detected the co-expression of IFN-\\u2425 with CD107a/b, and TNF-\\u2423 with Cd107a/b respectively. Interestingly, the data demonstrated that a population of CD107a/b + CD8 + T cells that did not produce IFN-\\u2425 or TNF-\\u2423 could be observed (Fig. 6B) . These data imply that measuring CD8 + T cell responses by IFN-\\u2425 production alone in previous studies may underestimate the total responses and the variety of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells in vivo.Based on the production of IFN-\\u2425 and the expression of CD107a/b, we found that the greater frequencies of IFN-\\u2425 + and CD107a/b + peptide-specific CD8 + T cells localized in lungs which were the major target site of SARS in humans, whereas secondly in spleens. The frequency of peptide-specific CD8 + T cell in lymph nodes was lower than that in spleens, which was at a low but detectable level (Fig. 7) . These data consist with the previous reports, which indicated in hepatitis B virus mouse models at each time point, the greatest frequency of specific CD8 + T cells was found in the liver, although the spleen had the largest number of antigenspecific CD8 + T cells [40] . Thus, it would be of value to determine after immunization whether there is any phenotypic or functional difference between antigen-specific memory CD8 + T cells in the lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissue, as is the case during viral infection.Besides, we investigated the phenotype of peptide-specific CD8 + T cells based on IFN-\\u2425 production. CD45 expression is frequently used to define memory T cells. CD45RB expression was decreased on effector T cells compared to naive T cells, whereas most memory cells, like naive T cells, expressed a CD45RB high phenotype [41] . In this study, the expression of CD45RB molecule was high on the most of IFN-\\u2425 producing CD8 + T cells. The presence of this naive phenotype on CD8 + T cells after antigen exposure has already been observed and could be explained by a re-expression after a down-regulation during the effector phase [42, 43] . CD62L, a surface protein that mediates homing to lymphoid organs, is reversible in vivo as already described [41, 42] . In fact, T CM express relatively high levels of CD62L and T EM express relatively low levels of this molecule. We observed rather 84% of a population of IFN-\\u2425 + CD8 + T cells with CD62L low and 16% of central memory IFN-\\u2425 + CD8 + T cells with CD62L high . These results are similar with the founding by Meraldi V who demonstrated most of multimer + CD8 + T cells had intermediate phenotype CD44 high , CD45RB high and CD62L low induced by polypeptide from plasmodium berghei, which might be ready to be conscripted into the effector population during reinfection [43] .To conclude, it has been shown that HLA-A*0201 restricted SARS S epitope-specific CD8 + T cells could protect body against viral infection in Tg mice model. Such protection is mediated by both cytolytic that represent by the expression of CD107a/b and non-cytolytic mechanisms, the latter as a result of IFN-\\u2425, TNF-\\u2423 and IL-2 production by CD8 + T cells. The distribution of peptidespecific CD8 + T cells which has memory T cell characteristics is different in lymphoid tissues and non-lymphoid tissues. Taken together, these data provided some novel information in cellular immune responses of SARS S antigen-specific CD8 + T cells, which were important in the development of vaccine against SARS-CoV infection. Therefore, we have a hypothesis that SARS S DNA prime and HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides boost vaccine may offer considerable potential in humans, both for preventative vaccines and for past exposure prophylaxis.China, for her help in mouse immunization.

reduce poverty. The eight goals address targets to increase incomes; reduce hunger; achieve universal primary education; eliminate gender inequality; reduce maternal and child mortality; reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; reverse the loss of natural resources and biodiversity; improve access to water, sanitation, and good housing; and establish eff ective global partnerships. Progress in some goals has been impressive; however, global targets will not be met in some regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. As we approach the 2015 target date, there is considerable interest in assessment of the present goals and in consideration of the future of development goals after 2015.This Commission has brought together sectoral experts on diff erent MDGs from the London International Development Centre to identify cross-cutting challenges that have emerged from MDG implementation so far. This interdisciplinary approach diff ers from previous MDG studies that have either examined individual goals or made broad sociopolitical assessments of the MDGs as a development mechanism. We used our analysis of crosscutting challenges as the basis to identify a set of principles for future goal development, after 2015. We emphasise that this report is not an assessment of the MDGs; we focus deliberately on challenges with the implementation of the MDGs so as to inform future goal setting.The MDGs are an assembly of sector-specifi c and often quite narrowly focused targets that have their various origins in development ideas and campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s. They were not derived from an inclusive analysis and prioritisation of development needs, and this is refl ected in the absence from them of a range of key development issues. The variable progress recorded with goals and targets partly indicates a tendency over time to focus on a subset of targets that have proven easier to implement and monitor, or which have stronger ownership by international or national institutions, or both. Complexity and lack of ownership have been particular problems for new targets added later in the MDG process. We provide short analyses of each MDG for those seeking more depth and to set out the evidence for a cross-MDG analysis (webappendix).Clearly the MDGs have had notable success in encouraging global political consensus, providing a focus\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) emerged from the United Nations (UN) Millennium Declaration in 2000, and are arguably the most politically important pact ever made for international development. 1 They identify specifi c development priorities across a very broad range, including poverty, education, gender, health, environment, and international partnerships. These goals have substantially shaped development dialogue and investment; some development agencies judge all their activities on the contribution to achievement of the MDGs. 2 Overall, progress towards the MDGs has been described as \"patchy\" 3 and \"uneven\". 4 The broad conclusion is that few goals are entirely on track globally, and those that are show substantial variation, with least progress in Africa and often south Asia. Whereas MDG 1 (eradication of extreme poverty and hunger) is on course to be achieved and \"remarkable improvements\" have been made regarding aspects of MDG 6 (combating of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases), insuffi cient progress has been made towards achievement of MDG 2 (provision of universal primary education), MDG 4 (reduction of child mortality), and MDG 5 (reduction of maternal mortality). 4, 5 Steps towards MDG 3 (promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women) have been labelled \"sluggish\"; \"alarmingly high\" rates of deforestation are hampering MDG 7 (ensuring of environmental sustainability); and Africa is \"short-changed\" by the aid fl ows included under MDG 8 (development of a global partnership for development). 4 Moreover, the global economic crisis has accentuated the urgency of the discussion, and progress is being jeopardised because of new fi nancial constraints. 6 As we approach the two-thirds mark for the achievement of these goals in 2015, attention is focused on acceleration of progress, and on whether these goals are the right model for international development after 2015. So far, analysis of the MDGs as models for international development has taken two forms. The fi rst involves sector-specifi c assessment of progress towards individual MDGs, largely by sectoral experts. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The second involves broader analysis of the MDGs as instruments of development, largely by international development specialists. 3, 12, 13 We believe that an understanding of the MDGs and future improvements in goal setting benefi ts from consideration of all goals together, because they are so interconnected and because their individual implementation has identifi ed many common issues. The purpose of this report is to identify challenges that have emerged in delivery of the MDGs that are common to diff erent goals and to suggest how future goal setting can be improved to avoid these diffi culties. We do not undertake to present a verdict on the MDGs, or a balanced assessment weighing advantages and disadvantages. We focus deliberately on problems with the MDGs to identify See Online for webappendix better future approaches. We will not propose specifi c changes in MDGs after 2015, but will suggest a set of principles that might guide future goal development. This Commission is intended for a broad readership interested in all MDGs and for a more health-focused readership, who we hope will gain an improved understanding of the important relations between health and other MDG targets.We begin part 1 of our report with a brief introduction to the MDGs, which is accompanied by a webappendix presenting analyses of the development and implementation of each MDG. In part 2, we present a cross-cutting comparison and analysis of MDGs 1-7. We restrict our analysis to these seven MDGs because they share a focus, across very diff erent sectors, on action in and by developing countries, whereas MDG 8 is focused more on actions by wealthy countries. We derive from this analysis the common challenges facing the MDGs. In part 3, we use these challenges to develop and illustrate fi ve principles for future development goal setting, with health as a theme.\\n\\nThis Commission was undertaken at the request of\\n\\nThe Lancet by the London International Development Centre (LIDC)-a consortium of six University of London colleges (Birkbeck, Institute of Education, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, School of Oriental and African Studies, Royal Veterinary College, and the School of Pharmacy). LIDC is dedicated to novel, intersectoral, and interdisciplinary approaches to international development. The Commission was codesigned with The Lancet, coordinated by LIDC, and prepared by experts in three LIDC member institutions: the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Institute of Education, and School of Oriental and African Studies, and their research partners in South Africa, Zambia, Malawi, India, and Thailand. This team brought specifi c, individual expertise with MDGs 1-7, from diff erent development perspectives and backgrounds. To build a team approach, each expert was asked with her or his partners to write a critique of their MDG and to contribute ideas arising from this analysis towards the design of future development goals. All participants read these papers as preparation for a 2-day facilitated workshop that identifi ed issues and challenges that cut across the MDGs and built a consensus about future development goal setting. During four subsequent, smaller workshops, this consensus was developed into a fi nal document. Although overseas partners could participate only in the fi rst main workshop, all contributed towards subsequent development and have made contributions to the fi nal version, including specifi c case studies. Analyses of individual MDGs are provided (webappendix) for readers interested in more detail. They provide the evidence base for the crosscutting analysis.\\n\\nBackground to the MDGs\\n\\nThe MDGs comprise a set of eight goals and associated targets and indicators. They represent the latest eff ort in a long process of development goal setting which had antecedents in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Development Decade of the 1960s, and the many UN summits of the second half of the 20th century that set specifi c goals to reduce hunger, improve health, eradicate diseases, and school children. 14 The immediate antecedent of the MDGs was the Millennium Declaration, presented in 2000 at the UN Millennium Summit. 15 The Millennium Declaration presented six values that were considered to be fundamental to international relations in the 21st century: freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for nature, and shared responsibility. Seven key objectives were identifi ed to translate these shared values into actions: peace, security, and disarmament; development and poverty eradication; protection of our common environment; human rights, democracy, and good governance; protection of vulnerable people; meeting of the special needs of Africa; and strengthening of the UN. The second objective, development and poverty eradication, was translated into eleven resolutions, presented as development targets. Many of these targets had legacies that predated the Millennium Declaration and had arisen from sector-specifi c UN-sponsored and other world conferences and summits during the previous decades. Most had appeared as international development targets in the report of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Shaping the 21st century: the contribution of development cooperation. 16 The OECD\\'s international development targets were particularly infl uential in the determination of the relevant text of the Millennium Declaration. With the addition of a few more targets, particularly for environmental sustainability, these became the MDGs. In turn these targets were linked post hoc with indicators, for the purposes of measurement, and with goals, for the purpose of conceptual simplicity. By 2001 the MDG framework comprised eight goals, 18 targets, and 48 indicators. 17 A few more targets and indicators were added later, creating the set presented in panel 1.To understand the MDGs, the political context in which they arose has to be appreciated. Several recent analyses have provided a useful insight into how the MDGs represent an integration of diff erent international development strategies and initiatives emerging over recent decades. Hulme, 19 for instance, suggests that the MDGs developed through an interaction between, on the one hand, a US-led, neo-liberal ideology (one that promotes economic growth based on free trade and markets) linked to results-based management and, on the other hand, a development approach of some other wealthy countries, multilaterals, and non-governmental organisation (NGOs) that focused on multidimensional For more on the London International Development Centre see http://www.lidc. org.uk human development-eg, health, education, and gender equity, treating these as both development goals and development means. The emerging goals are biased towards a human development approach-\"fi ve and a half of the eight MDGs are about enhancing human capabilities\" 19 -and there is a strong emphasis on basic needs. However, they also incorporate neo-liberal thinking about economic growth into their important poverty goal (MDG 1), and their overall results-based framework focused greatly on international development partnerships. Manning 3 observes how the early neo-liberal leanings of the goals were tempered by recognition of the need for buy-in by developing countries and by NGOs, leading to the inclusion of goals more focused on human welfare and development, such as health and education.In addition to their integration of diff erent development challenges and approaches, the MDGs also provided a novel, target-oriented framework for the international development community. Gore 13 suggests that in tempering earlier neo-liberal approaches to development with human development objectives, the MDGs represent a switch from a \"procedural conception of international society\" to a \"purposive conception\". The former involves \"an association of States joined together through their common respect for a set of rules, norms and standard practices which govern the relationships between them\" whereas the latter involves \"an association of States joined together in a cooperative venture to promote common ends\". 13 With this target focus came an important shift from maximalist views of development (in which development involves poorer countries achieving aspirations of equality with richer countries) to minimalist standards (of proportions of people crossing poverty thresholds or accessing particular services or avoiding mortality or morbidity); and from societal and national change to changes for individuals within nation states. The emphasis on specifi c and minimalist targets, and the way in which it narrowed the development agenda and placed particular responsibilities on developing country governments, has generated many of the challenges facing implementation of the MDGs.Our study is based on the comparison of experiences across the diff erent MDGs. To facilitate this comparison, we provide analyses of each MDG: how it was developed, how it has been implemented, and what this information tells us about its success so far. This analysis is provided in the webappendix, which we recommend readers consult for a deeper understanding of MDG performance. We use the analyses of MDGs 1-7 as the evidence base for our analysis in part 2 of this Commission.These MDG analyses show that the MDGs and their targets all have their origins in development initiatives that predate the Millennium Declaration. For the most part, the MDGs constitute an assembly of often very narrowly focused and sector-specifi c development ideas and campaigns from the 1980s and 1990s. Their targets are often so narrow as to neglect important development issues in the same sector-eg, tertiary education, reproductive health, and a range of gender issues. At their conception, therefore, the MDGs were not a plan derived bottom-up from a broad, intersectoral conceptualisation of development and prioritisation of development needs, although superfi cially they might seem to have been. These summaries also show that progress has varied between goals and between targets. Although some goals were set up with a range of targets and indicators, subsequent attention and monitoring for any goal has usually focused on a subset of these targets and indicators, sometimes only one. This narrowing process could be an indication of diff erences in ease of target implementation and monitoring, and in the level of ownership by international and other institutions, with little ownership or overlap in ownership reducing progress. Generally, eff orts to improve MDGs by adding new targets at a later date have not been very successful, owing to the complexity of these targets and their indicators or to limited ownership, or both.\\n\\nPositive contributions of the MDGs\\n\\nIn this section, we use our studies of individual MDGs as the evidence base from which we build a cross-cutting analysis. When appropriate, we relate our conclusions to other reviews of the MDGs that have used a range of approaches. 2, 3, 12, 13, 15, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] The performance of individual MDGs so far suggests that they have made four important positive contributions: encouraging global political consensus, providing a focus for advocacy, improving the targeting and fl ow of aid, and improving the monitoring of development projects.Endorsed by 189 governments, the MDGs represent an unprecedented consensus on international development. In this context, they have been more successful than have some of the UN\\'s earlier development initiatives, such as the Development Decades of the 1960-90s or the resolutions about Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States. 3 In a 2005 survey of 118 countries, 86% had reportedly acted in response to the MDGs. 25 The MDGs are claimed to be \"the fi rst global development vision that combines a global political endorsement with a clear focus on, and means to engage directly with, the world\\'s poor people\". 1 The survey of individual MDGs (webappendix) shows how the MDGs have helped advocacy of particular development agendas. For popular agendas, such as those to reduce poverty (MDG 1) and infectious diseases (MDG 6), MDGs provided additional leverage, whereas for relatively neglected agendas such as child survival (MDG 4) and gender (MDG 3), their eff ect was to reinvigorate these campaigns. In the case of gender, for example, the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995 had led to the establishment of gender (Continued from previous page)• Indicator 6.3: proportion of population aged 15-24 years with comprehensive correct knowledge of HIV/AIDS • Indicator 6.4: ratio of school attendance of orphans to school attendance of non-orphans aged 10-14 years • Target 6B: achieve, by 2010, universal access to treatment for HIV/AIDS for all those who need it • Indicator 6.5: proportion of population with advanced HIV infection with access to antiretroviral drugs • Target 6C: have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the incidence of malaria and other major diseases • Indicator 6.6: incidence and death rates associated with malaria • Indicator 6.7: proportion of children younger than 5 years sleeping under insecticide-treated bednets • Indicator 6.8: proportion of children younger than 5 years with fever who are treated with appropriate antimalarial drugs • Indicator 6.9: incidence, prevalence, and death rates associated with tuberculosis • Indicator 6.10: proportion of tuberculosis cases detected and cured under directly observed treatment short course mechanisms and approaches to mainstreaming of gender issues within several ministries. Their achievements were fragile, 26, 27 until the MDGs stimulated donors to include gender equity in aid packages. [28] [29] [30] The MDGs are generally thought to have improved the targeting and fl ow of aid and other investments, supported by the way in which donors have linked the MDGs to their strategies for aid provision 6 and by evidence of an increase in resource mobilisation. 21 According to OECD fi gures, between 2000, when the Millennium Declaration was adopted, and 2006, total development assistance for health has more than doubled from US$6·8 billion to $16·7 billion, most of it focused on infectious diseases (MDG 6). 31 Large increases in donors\\' fi nancial commitments to education, which can fairly transparently be linked to MDG 2, were recorded after 2000.However, the cases of health and education also show how diffi cult it is to establish a cause and eff ect relationship between the MDGs and an increase in aid. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw the conceptualisation and creation of several independent initiatives in health and education, including the International Finance Facility for Immunisation; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; Business Alliance Against Chronic Hunger; and the initiatives following the Education for All conferences in Jomtien (1990) and Dakar (2000) , whose objectives overlapped with those adopted subsequently in MDG 6 and MDG 2. The contribution of the MDGs, in these cases, might best be viewed as reinforcing, rather than driving, the targeting and mobilisation of resources.Finally, the MDGs have stimulated an improvement in monitoring development programmes through data collection and analysis: \"Once the MDGs gained currency, a cascade of statistical and analytical work got underway\". 23 Although we have noted that across the MDGs there are profound questions about the quality of the data obtained from such monitoring, few would disagree that it has been benefi cial to evaluation, and probably to investment.\\n\\nChallenges posed by the MDGs\\n\\nSet against these positive contributions are several shortcomings that emerge consistently across our analysis of individual MDGs. Characteristically, most of these weaknesses present themselves as the fl ip side of the MDGs\\' more positive elements. Thus, the parsimony of the MDGs, which has probably facilitated their acceptance and use, makes them at the same time limited in scope, whereas their quantitative targets and precise indicators, for all their value in providing measurable outcomes, often fail to capture some crucial elements of goal achievement. We have to accept that all goal setting involves such trade-off s.However, the value of focusing on shortcomings of the MDGs lies in our potential to improve them, or replace them with something better. Ineff ective MDGs pose two risks: they might not achieve their intended eff ect, and they could lead to negative eff ects by ignoring or impeding more eff ective development and poverty reduction. Our analysis identifi es challenges with the MDGs in four areas: conceptualisation, execution, ownership, and equity. Other studies have also identifi ed cross-cutting issues, 12,22 which we will discuss as appropriate.\\n\\nConceptualisation and execution\\n\\nWe consider fi rst how well the MDGs have been developed at diff erent levels-goal, target, and indicator-which has obvious consequences for how well they have been executed at each level. For instance, an indicator for which accurate data cannot be obtained is poorly conceived and prevents execution of the target. In table 1 we show some diffi culties relating to conceptualisation and execution, drawn from our individual analyses of the MDGs presented in the webappendix. This list is illustrative and not meant to be comprehensive. Problems with the conceptualisation and execution of the MDGs arise at the goal, target, and indicator levels. This feature is shared by diff erent MDGs, and some goals have problems at more than one level. Broadly speaking, problems associated with the level of goals seem to relate to their being too narrow and fragmented, leaving gaps in which other important development objectives are missing. Problems at the target level often relate to their being incomplete or partial relative to the ambition of the goal, imprecise, or without a process of delivery. These problems tend to amplify the vertical nature of some goals, widening the gaps between them and reducing connectedness. Between 2005 and 2008, MDGs 1, 3, and 5 added targets aimed specifi cally at fi lling such gaps. Problems with indicators tend to be associated with measurement, ownership, or leadership. New indicators added during the course of the MDGs are especially prone to these problems.\\n\\nProblems with goals\\n\\nAs we noted in part 1, the MDGs represent a subset of a broader development vision expressed in the Millennium Declaration. Goals were never developed for several key objectives of the Declaration, including peace, security and disarmament, and human rights. The elements taken into the MDGs were in fact the specifi c targets associated with only one objective of the Declaration, that of development and poverty eradication. Some of these goals, being themselves derived from specifi c targets, were very narrow in conception: education goals focused mainly on primary education, whereas health goals focused only on three aspects of health associated with maternal mortality, child mortality, and specifi c diseases. For goals that were more broadly defi ned, such as poverty reduction, gender, or environmental sustainability, the few targets assigned to them did not capture their breadth. The consequences of building goals around targets were two-fold. First, very substantial gaps existed in the coverage of goals, with targets failing to address important development needs for that sector. Second, because narrow goals and targets were so fragmented, the potential linkages and synergies that exist between diff erent sectors proved diffi cult to exploit.Gaps in goals could have contributed to underinvestment in areas that are key to realisation of the MDGs\\' overall development vision. For instance, considering that most of the world\\'s poor people are rural farmers, and that agricultural production and its distribution are key factors in reducing hunger, the absence of agricultural targets from MDG 1 is striking. Did this leave us unprepared for the food price crisis of 2007 and the need to make food security a global agenda? The focus of MDG 2 on primary education and enrolment has led in some countries to a so-called policy myopia, and a neglect of both learning level achievement and of secondary and post-secondary education, with important implications for economic growth. MDG 3\\'s very narrow scope failed to capture several intrinsic women\\'s rights issues such as freedom from violence and adult literacy, which are two areas of extreme inequality. In some cases, these gaps have been addressed by additional targets, but these late additions, relative to original targets, tend not to have leadership or easily measured indicators (table 1).Urban and Sumner 32 identify the lack of attention to tackling climate change (which receives little mention in MDG 7) as one of the fundamental criticisms of the MDG framework. Similar to the examples above, its limited emphasis in the MDGs could be indicative of political sensitivity or lack of eff ective advocacy, but it also draws attention to the extent to which development priorities change over time, and the challenges facing a fi xed set of development goals.Problems with targets delivering goals Problems with indicators delivering targets For example, by targeting largely primary education, MDG 2 underdevelops secondary and tertiary education, for which opportunities to create substantial improvements in incomes and in health are greatest. These educational levels also generate the skilled workers that are needed to promote and service the non-education MDGs-in health, agriculture, water and sanitation, and environmental sustainability-and teachers for the achievement of MDG 2.Similarly, the little focus on nutrition within the MDGs fails to exploit the synergy of increasing household food security, improving children\\'s capacity to participate in and benefi t from education, and increasing resilience to maternal and infant disease threats. Table 2 shows some of the links between education, health, poverty reduction, and gender goals, from which it will be clear that many are unrealised in the present MDG framework because of the narrowness of MDG targeting.The interactions between education, poverty reduction, health, and gender are complex. Primary education provides access to higher levels of education, which raises earnings, 37, 38 while higher levels of female education lead to improvements in child health care. 39 These fi ndings indicate clear gains in poverty reduction through investments in education. But education\\'s relations with poverty, health, and gender are reciprocal. Children from poorer households enrol in fewer years of education, and in many systems poor girls enrol in fewer years than do poor boys. 9 Better child health and nutrition improve educational outcomes. 40, 41 These gender interactions are typical of those across the MDGs. Jones and colleagues 42 have shown how the failure to disaggregate data for men and women for poverty and sustainable development masks the gender dynamics of poverty, making the point that all stakeholders should \"champion the importance of gender equality as a cross-cutting issue that needs to be considered in all pro-poor policy and programming, including those aimed at MDG achievement\".In the present MDG process, some positive interaction will inevitably arise from the independent pursuit of diff erent MDG goals and targets, but even this interaction will need local interventions in poverty reduction, health, education, and gender equality coming together for the same groups of people. This convergence is made less likely by the reality that goals are compartmentalised into responsibilities of diff erent line ministries nationally, subnationally, and locally, which means that the potential for simultaneous actions in the same location, working with the same communities and households, is unlikely.Problems with targets delivering goals Problems with indicators delivering targets (Continued from previous page) \\n\\nFragmentation and lack of synergy\\n\\nThe gaps created by the fragmentation of goals and targets not only emphasise the omission of important development needs, but also fail to realise effi ciencies and even synergies arising from the potential links between goals. The narrow focus of the three health goals, MDGs 4, 5, and 6, tends to encourage vertical organisation of planning, fi nancing, procurement, delivery, monitoring, and reporting without suffi cient linkage or integration with the broader health system. 33 A lack of integration and effi ciency can be seen internationally, with UN agencies or departments competing for attention and funding (some of which predated the creation of the MDGs); nationally with diff erent rewards and incentives for staff in diff erent programmes; and at the level of service delivery, for which particular programmes might have more generous space, equipment, or staffi ng levels than others, although the extent of this problem varies substantially across settings. Few of the technical interventions needed to achieve these three MDGs are logically or most costeff ectively delivered on their own. 34 Most health-service delivery is multipurpose and depends on horizontal systems, including the physical infrastructure, personnel, procurement and governance policies, and audit and monitoring systems.We are not saying that health systems do not need specifi c specialised services to address particular diseases such as HIV/AIDS, but that such services, although necessary, are not suffi cient to ensure sustainable health improvement into the future, with the exception of health improvement related to the very few diseases that can be eradicated, such as smallpox. Although investment in vertical health programmes could bring resources, such as new health centres, that benefi t health systems overall, their focus on particular diseases means that other national needs might be unsupported. For example, a study in Mali found that a campaign to treat neglected tropical diseases disrupted basic health services at health centres because of staff absences; and in 14 of 16 health centres staff were overburdened by the additional requirements of the campaign. 35 Similarly, vertical programmes bring investment in accounting and procurement services that could strengthen national health systems generally, but which could in practice be limited to servicing specifi c disease programmes, running in parallel to weak national systems. In countries where human resources are scarce, such as most low-income countries, staff move to where salaries, incentives, and working conditions are best. Thus although allocation for disease-specifi c funding might increase human resources in health systems, human resources might be drawn into specifi c programmes, neglecting other parts of the health system.Eff ective health systems need both vertical and horizontal components, and the MDGs have focused investment on the former, with the result that global health initiatives (GHIs) established with mandates to address specifi c diseases (such as The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; or the US President\\'s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief [PEPFAR]) or tightly focused objectives (such as the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation) have had a variable eff ect on improving national health systems. 36 Several of these GHIs are now working to broaden their remit to address the horizontal aspects of health-system strengthening more directly.The narrowness of MDG goals and targets also does not realise effi ciencies and synergies between sectors.\\n\\nTable 1: Goals and targets for MDGs 1-7, with observations on diffi culties with conceptualisation and execution\\n\\nHowever, precedents for such synergy can arise from targeted interventions in the same communities. For example, the Mid-day Meal programme reaches 120 million primary school children every school day in India and provides a cooked meal. The introduction of this nutrition programme has greatly raised school attendance 43 and, in conjunction with agricultural services, can stimulate farm input and output markets and agricultural development. Environmental sustainability should be a cross-cutting goal with potentials for synergy across sectors. However, MDG 7 targets 7A and 7B are not expressed in a way that links them to human welfare and development, making such linkage diffi cult. This shortcoming could be addressed with the concept of ecosystem services, whose development in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment paralleled the implementation of the MDGs. The role of ecosystems services is refl ected in the need for sustainable provision of water, soil, and biodiversity services to support agriculture and achievement of MDG 1 targets, and the importance of environmental factors to improved health. For example, 24% of the global disease burden is estimated to be associated with environmental factors, and 25% of all deaths in developing countries are linked to environmental risks. 44 The fragmentation of the MDGs has probably resulted in several lost opportunities to improve development outcomes. At its heart, of course, is the longstanding fragmentation of most human knowledge and activity into so-called sectoral \"silos\"-such as health, education, environment, etc-and even into separate silos within sectors, as seen clearly with health targets spread across MDGs 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. At the intergovernmental and intragovernmental level, this isolation is reinforced by a long tradition of institutional ownership and disciplinary identities that are embedded in professional qualifi cation systems, societies, and journals. By simply gathering together established goals and targets of these diff erent development communities, the MDGs could not hope to achieve the desired integrated approach that is appropriate to complex problems in international development. Worse, by fostering traditional and institutional ownership of diff erent MDG goals, the MDGs reinforced their isolation.\\n\\nProblems with targets and their indicators\\n\\nWe now consider the extent to which MDG targets and indicators have been designed to deliver its goals eff ectively. The use of a results-based framework is regarded as one of the strengths of the MDGs, and has certainly appealed in an aid context with the desire of donors to see measurable returns on investment. A focus on measurable MDG results does, however, mean that indicators are selected that capture neither the complexity of the target, because of the need for parsimony, nor the qualitative nature of much development progress. As indicated in the review of individual MDGs (webappendix) and table 1, this problem is common to many MDGs. MDG 2 provides a particularly clear example of how specifi c targets can be met without achieving their full intent. For this goal, the measurable target identifi ed for achievement of universal primary education is to ensure that, by 2015, all boys and girls are able to complete a full course of primary schooling. This target is accompanied by three indicators, of which only the fi rst, the net enrolment ratio, has been consistently measured, because the others are more diffi cult to assess. Hence progress on MDG 2 has been represented by changes in this ratio. However, this measure entails a very narrow view of primary education. In some contexts, enrolment in education, even in the last grade of primary, can mean\\n\\nEff ect on education Eff ect on health Eff ect on poverty and hunger reduction\\n\\nEff ect on gender equality Improvement in education .. Encourages good health practices, delays marriage, reduces fertility and child mortality, and improves maternal health; primary education provides access to secondary and post-secondary education and skilled health workers Improves agricultural productivity and off -farm employment opportunities; primary education provides access to secondary and post-secondary education and generates a skilled workforce Once targets are seen to be achieved, attention may be directed elsewhere. If target achievement falls short of goal achievement, then it is possible that further progress will not be made against that goal. In panel 3, we show this risk with an example of MDG 3 from South Africa.In conclusion, targets and their indicators frequently fall short of being meaningful measures of MDG achievement-for instance in MDG 2 with the net enrolment ratio as a proxy for education, in MDG 1 with income as a proxy for poverty reduction, and in MDG 3 with gender equity in schools as a proxy for societal change in gender equity. This criticism might seem rather severe-specifi c targets and indicators were never meant to measure all progress against a complex goal. Rather, they were meant to be indicative of progress. The risk, however, is that once targets and indicators become established, their indicative function is forgotten, and they become the end, not the means, of the MDGs. Such goal displacement, in which targets and indicators become more important than achievement of goals, is a common feature in management.A feature of MDG targets that has often been seen as a virtue is their caution not to prescribe how a target or its indicators should be achieved, although some are a partial means to a goal. This approach has mostly worked, insofar as a target for disease reduction or education, for example, is adopted by a particular development community which will identify or already have in place strategies for achieving it, as was the case for MDG 2. Nevertheless, this ownership of targets also fosters territorial attitudes.However, too little detail has proven to be a problem for other MDGs. MDG 1, for example, with its goal of halving poverty and hunger, does not have any indicators concerned with service access or with policy interventions. As with other goals, it has results-based outcome targets, relating to proportions of people above income thresholds, in employment, and underweight at a particular age, but no targets for mechanisms contributing to these outcomes-ie, it has no output targets. MDG 7 has a similar problem in that it has targets that encourage policies which reduce the loss of biodiversity and other natural resources, as outcomes, but it has no output targets in terms of policy interventions. Targets with these problems have less chance of eff ective execution than do others, since they are based only on observation of outcomes.The results-based nature of the MDG framework means that availability of good quality data is necessary to the use of specifi c indicators that monitor progress towards targets and goals. But national information systems are still weak in many countries, and data, if available, are likely to be of poor quality. This problem is compounded by technical diffi culties for some of the MDGs\\' indicators that might not be easy to measure yearly. For example, the number of children eligible to be enrolled in school forms the denominator of net and gross enrolment ratios. These ratios should be calculated every year, but population estimates are typically taken in a census once a decade.Our cross-MDG comparison suggests that, for most MDGs, only a few of several indicators are regularly measured and others fall away as yearly reporting progresses. The reasons are usually associated with the issues discussed in this section surrounding diffi culty of measurement, but leadership is also an issue. Where commitment to national or international measurement is limited, then indicators are rarely measured. Lack of measurement is a particular problem with more recently added targets, for instance in MDGs 1, 3, and 5, perhaps for reasons that they are either more complex or less broadly owned than others.Finally, criticism of the use of targets and indicators has to be tempered by the positive eff ect of the MDG process in stimulation of a culture of assessment, leading to investment in data collection and in monitoring and assessment in many countries, as well as regionally and subnationally. The MDGs have also inspired valuable research in the area of development eff ectiveness, which will benefi t future goal setting.\\n\\nOwnership\\n\\nThe MDG framework seemed to represent an important political consensus; that 189 countries signed up to one development plan was of huge symbolic signifi cance. It also off ered the potential to ensure national ownership Guy Collender, LIDC around global commitments. However, despite the widespread support for the MDGs internationally, to ensure ownership of the MDG process-including development and implementation-at diff erent levels and by diff erent stakeholders has been problematic.Multilateral and bilateral agencies were heavily involved in the early development of the MDG framework as it emerged from OECD DAC and UN processes. Although they were brought in at the later stages of the process, and were signatories to the MDG framework, thus agreeing to work towards their implementation, the involvement of developing countries in the initial development of the framework was small. As a result, meaningful national ownership by developing countries has been mixed and often weak. We will consider ownership of the MDGs at three levels-by the international development community, by civil society, and by national programmes in developing countries-and the problems associated with each.The principle of ownership arises from our analysis in part 2 (and particularly the lack of MDG ownership that might exist nationally), from our conceptualisation of wellbeing as including participation and voice, and from our consideration of the requirements for sustainability. Much of the discussion of ideas of global social justice focuses on the problems of attending to diff erent local, national, regional, and global communities, and the politics of articulating and negotiating very diff erent interests, 109, 110 and our method for elaboration of this conception of development has taken as a starting point the acceptance of a plurality of societies in the world.We have seen in our examples from diff erent countries that MDGs have usually been incorporated into national development programmes where they fi t local priorities. Alternatively, MDGs could stimulate a change in national priorities if donor funding for MDGs causes governments to change their strategies to take advantage of opportunities for external investment. These observations suggest a need for greater ownership of the process of goal development both nationally and internationally. Questions about who sets goals, how they are represented and legitimated, and what relationships they have with targets must be of central concern. National and local ownership and a new framework for international partnerships will be crucial for what comes next, both in terms of refl ection on the nature of global obligation and the establishment of particular goals and targets.We propose that the search for developmental goals after 2015 should begin from a comprehensive conceptualisation of development and the core development principles proposed to govern both the specifi cations of development goals and the processes by which they are specifi ed. This process should be undertaken, and its product owned, by all countries by use of forms of open discussion and public scrutiny, as suggested by Sen, 95 and we emphasise therefore that our set of principles and elements of wellbeing are only examples of what these principles and elements might look like.However, these goals might subsequently have to be narrowed or otherwise amended to achieve comprehensive commitment to the development agenda. Goal setting at this level should focus on the planning of national and local programmes by national constituencies. National priorities will diff er, but all agreed elements of wellbeing should be considered, such that diff erences refl ect local priorities. Priorities would need to be developed through an equitable process of discussion and deliberation with some agreed processes of how consensus was to be reached with regard to national priorities. Operationally, a process that is given suffi cient time to include civil society participation (and appropriate accountability processes) would be needed. A focus on local priorities would be important to ensure that targets set are locally relevant, not only national aggregates, and that they do not aim too low.National target setting would need an element of regional and global input, especially to address environmental development needs that are supranational, such as climate change adaptation and mitigation, and to address international issues such as the eff ect of trade or migration of skilled workers on human and social elements of wellbeing. A process to integrate local, national, and regional priorities to generate national, regional, and global targets will thus be needed, with mechanisms to reach consensus. Although brokering and negotiation between powerful players is one way to achieve this process, a better approach might be to adopt mechanisms that allow subsidiarity, opt outs, or variations in specifi cation of targets between global, regional, national, and subnational jurisdictions-although of course these are not without their challenges.Equally important for ownership is a mechanism to review progress towards targets that ensures national dialogue (involving governments and civil society) around the targets and the data associated with them. This mechanism could entail: independent national bodies established and tasked with monitoring progress with wide participation of a range of groups; national collection and review of data; external comparative analysis in partnership with multilateral bodies or international organisations; and national analysis and decision on action in the form of public, parliamentary, press, or other forms of debate and discussion. The changing international architecture of the UN would be an important backdrop to this process, with action to avoid the present fragmentation of development goals between diff erent UN bodies, through strong central leadership. UN agencies could assist with the circulation of information, convening of meetings 26 for crucial refl ection across countries, and identifi cation of where particular resources for initiatives might be located. But the dynamism associated with other cross-national organisations of civil society would also be an important resource.\\n\\nOwnership by the international community\\n\\nImplementation diffi culties for some MDGs are indicative of the institutional structure around the MDGs and, in some cases, lack of or confusion around ownership between diff erent UN and multilateral agencies. For instance, the absence of ownership of MDG 3 inter nationally has made it particularly diffi cult to implement. Reactions have been mixed nationally, although the decision of the Commission on the Status of Women in 2009 sought to link together the Beijing Platform of Action and advancement of MDG 3 through the work of the UN Division for the Advancement of Women. 55 Territorial issues with leadership have also aff ected implementation. This eff ect is most noticeable with health, for which the various health MDGs, by design, were mapped onto the institutional structure of health interests. The HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria professional groups, NGOs, and research community\\'s link to MDG 6; the maternal health community to MDG 5; and the child health community (with another strong professional group, the paediatricians) to MDG 4. A further, important, interest group that strengthens the position of MDG 6 relative to the others is that of the pharmaceutical industry, which has clear fi nancial interests in funding streams that are associated with the purchase of relatively costly drugs and commodities such as antiretroviral drugs, and received particular mention in MDG 8.In principle, institutional ownership should improve leadership, but this eff ect might not arise when ownership is too fragmented or when it is contested. For example, within the UN agencies, the ownership of maternal health is split, causing a scarcity of leadership for MDG 5. Within WHO, the lead technical agency, maternal health is split between Making Pregnancy Safer, the Human Reproduction Programme, and (for newborn babies) the Department for Child and Adolescent Health. Among agencies with funds for implementation, both UNICEF and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) have a role, which can be crudely defi ned as UNICEF being concerned with antenatal and postnatal care, and UNFPA with delivery care. In practice, activity depends on strengths in country. UNICEF adopts a community focus, and UNFPA staff traditionally have reproductive rather than maternal health expertise. The World Bank has played less of a lead in recent years, and a global fund does not specifi cally address maternal health. An attempt to pull together groups within the Partnership for Maternal Newborn and Child Health has been only partly successful so far, and did not always receive full backing by the UN agencies themselves.\\n\\nPanel 2: diffi culties with targets for MDG 2 in India\\n\\nThe target for MDG 2 aims to have all children completing a full course of primary schooling. For India, estimates suggest that close to 95% of children aged 6-14 years are enrolled in school. 45 The Indian Government has a policy of automatic promotion from one grade to the next each year, which implies that it is not diffi cult for enrolled children to move from grade 1 to grade 5.But is enrolment a good measure for understanding who is in school regularly? Several studies have shown that despite very high enrolment, regular attendance in school is an issue of major concern in some states. Government data from 2006 show that in 11 of the 20 major states, average attendance in primary school was less than 80%. 46 When measured very carefully, fi ndings from the SchoolTELLS study showed that for the school year 2007-08, in the schools sampled for the study, only 25% of enrolled children in Bihar and 44% in Uttar Pradesh attended school regularly. 47 The visit of researchers from Assessment Survey Evaluation Research (ASER) in 2009 to a school on a random day indicated that attendance was lower than 80% in ten of 20 major states, with numbers below 60% being recorded in populous and educationally underperforming states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. 45 In poor regions, despite incentives such as free school meals, uniforms, scholarships, and textbooks, children are not regularly in school. Stable and regular attendance patterns are an essential condition for eff ective teaching and learning. Closer tracking of attendance needs to be a high priority for state governments in India.No national longitudinal study has been done in India that follows successive cohorts of children from the fi rst year until the last year of primary school or beyond, so the primary school completion target is diffi cult to measure accurately. With the assumption that a large majority of children actually do complete primary schooling, assessment of what benefi ts the achievement of this target would represent is crucial, given that the MDG goal does not include a universal learning target. For the past 5 years the ASER survey has been measuring basic reading levels across India. ASER 2009 reports that only 52·8% of rural children in India in standard fi ve can fl uently read text at standard two level. 45 The situation for mathematics is even more dismal. Less than 40% of children in standard fi ve can do a numerical division problem (three digit by one digit division) correctly. Most states in India expect children to reach this level by the end of standard three or four. Therefore by the time that an average rural Indian child completes the primary stage she or he is at least 2-3 years academically behind where she or he is expected to be. At least half of all children in India are leaving primary school not being able to read fl uently or do basic arithmetic operations. Where does this evidence point us? What needs to be done to ensure a meaningful completion of primary school? Criteria for measurement of progress towards the completion goal have to include methods and mechanisms to assess children\\'s and teachers\\' attendance in schools regularly. Next, clear learning goals need to be articulated. It is against these benchmarks of enrolment, attendance, survival, and learning that the MDG 2 goal of completion needs to be measured.UNICEF and WHO have also had a complex relationship over involvement in, and ownership of, MDG 4. By the time that they became involved, other organisations had taken the lead in a fi eld that was traditionally theirs. Discord between WHO and UNICEF seems to have worsened during the 1990s, with WHO taking a lead role in the development and implementation of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI), while UNICEF moved into the technical leadership role that was traditionally occupied by WHO.The MDG process has largely been seen as donor driven, and issues of concern to civil society have been neglected from the agenda. This view is evident in MDG 2 with the narrowing of the Education For All agenda to the MDG agenda of Universal Primary Education, and in MDG 3 for which issues of concern to the global women\\'s movement, including violence against women, reproductive rights, and adult literacy, were not included in the targets. In this case, there was a struggle between gender and women\\'s right activists as to whether to ignore the MDGs altogether and continue mobilisation around the Beijing Platform or whether to engage tactically with the MDG process and try to secure commitment that MDG 3 would not be overlooked. 56 The mismatch between civil society agendas and those in the highly selected MDGs has implications for the ways in which civil society mobilises around the MDGs, and plays a part nationally in holding governments to account on their commitments. When particular MDGs do not include issues of concern to civil society they are unlikely to be a main focus of their advocacy eff orts, nationally or globally.The MDG discourse seems to have been used most successfully by the international community to drive for funds. Advocacy has been benefi cial and eff ective when what is wanted nationally coincides with international advocacy eff orts. This has been particularly the case in health, with the renaissance of child survival prompted by MDG 4, and with the supportive role of MDG 6 in mobilising funding for reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS.The domination of wealthy countries and their development communities in the MDG process also generates a problem of representation and asymmetry in the process of development of the MDG targets, whereby those with the money chose the targets. Although targets for poor countries are emphasised, the MDGs that by their nature involved wealthy and poor countries, MDG 7 and MDG 8, fell short of setting specifi c targets. Poverty rather than inequity is regarded as the challenge, thereby relieving wealthy countries of having targets of their own.\\n\\nNational ownership\\n\\nIn 2003, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) pronounced \"Governments, aid agencies and civil society organizations everywhere are re-orienting their work around the Goals\". 1 Indeed, many low-income countries have made an eff ort to link their own national development strategies to the MDGs, which can provide impetus for the achievement of both. Panel 4 shows how the Government of Malawi has made use of the MDGs. Other national plans that were able to be incorporated into the MDGs included Vision 2025 in Tanzania and Vision 2020 in Rwanda. 22 However, in view of the importance that donors put on the MDGs, governments might feel pressure to show progress against their specifi c targets, whatever their national priorities might be. The MDGs are frequently mentioned by ministries in the poorest countries, and are often referred to in poverty reduction strategy papers. 22, 25 Fukuda-Parr\\'s analysis of 22 such papers has shown how almost all of them mentioned the MDGs, but the focus in most countries was selective. 22 Developing countries could be merely seeking to satisfy donor expectations in their reference to MDGs in poverty reduction strategy papers, and local documents might amount to \"little more than political correctness\". 3 China presents a particularly clear case of the discrepancy between how donors and developing countries regard the MDGs. The UK Department for International Development\\'s priorities regarding China are couched in MDG discourse, particularly MDGs 2, 6, and 7, yet there is an explicit recognition that the Chinese Government does not approach the country\\'s development in the same way. 59 China does not have an overarching document such as a poverty reduction strategy paper that describes how it aims to reduce poverty and achieve the MDGs. Many of the same sectors covered in the MDGs appear in China\\'s 5-year plan for 2006-11, yet the targets diff er. For example, ambitions include average education for citizens to be increased to 9 years, and 100 million rural residents to be provided with access to safe drinking water. 60 The MDGs are an irrelevance to China\\'s own development strategy. InThe printed journal includes an image merely for illustration some cases the infl exible nature of the MDG framework, and the focus on targets rather than broader goals, has contributed to countries distancing themselves from a global agenda that is seen as irrelevant to their particular developmental situation.For low-income countries, however, the donor resources associated with the MDGs can be attractive to governments that are struggling to meet their own strategic targets. For example, the provision of antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS-an element of MDG 6-has been favoured by donors such as PEPFAR, but not always as a priority in country-led health strategies. Panel 5 shows how the national health strategy of Zambia has shifted to improve incorporation of this and other MDG targets. Although this approach could be seen as donor-driven distortion of national strategy, it also is indicative of a pragmatic national desire to develop benefi cial health strategies that have a high chance of successful implementation.If particular issues are not already regarded as priorities for governments, they might simply not be taken up, other than to fulfi l obligations for reporting of, or responding to, donor priorities. This has been a particular problem with MDGs 3 and 5 because of the low status of women. Finally, the mismatch of global goals with national circumstances or priorities could create perverse incentives that misdirect time and resources. Countries that are faced with a range of locally challenging or inappropriate targets might be inclined to focus on those actions that will contribute most to their overall MDG progress results. These actions might be directed towards population groups who are quick to respond, raising issues of equity that we will explore in the next section.A particular problem with MDG ownership is the extent to which global goals have been inappropriately interpreted as national ones. Each MDG, apart from MDG 8, has a global target to be achieved by 2015, usually set as a relative level of progress from the level in 1990 based on historical global trends. These global targets are also set without adjustment as country-level targets. They were never intended as national targets, but they have been consistently applied in this manner, ignoring local context and the intercountry diff erence in technical feasibility and fi nancial aff ordability. The application of global goals to poor African countries which were never expected individually to meet them generates defeatism and negativity locally, and \"Afropessimism\" on an international scale. 24 The linear extrapolations on which several MDG targets are based might possibly fi t the averaging that is inherent in setting global goals, but they could be entirely inappropriate as a measure of national progress. For example, the capacity to reduce child mortality rates in any country is more likely to be S-shaped than linear. 69 Initial eff orts in the presence of high mortality rates need much eff ort for modest improvements. Then as services in health systems are established, there is a phase during which substantial improvements are possible with rather less input. Finally, there is a phase in which much greater eff ort and resources are needed to make further improvements. The assumption that a similar eff ort in any country will produce a similar reduction in child mortality was naive, since experience with child mortality reduction shows that for most African countries to achieve MDG 4 will be almost impossible.\\n\\nPanel 3: Achievement of MDG 3 in South Africa\\n\\nInternationally, the MDGs act as a powerful public relations exercise. While governments have their own national goals and targets developed and responsive to a national political dynamic, pressure to meet the international development goals is particularly strong because it exposes government performance in a global arena. This pressure has the advantage of holding national political leaders to account against clearly quantifi able targets, but can also lead to governments manipulating statistics or to complacency by which targets seem to be met.One problem with ticking off the indicator for a target as a success is that it may blunt initiatives to fulfi l wider dimensions of the goal. A focus on quantity might aim to include as many people as possible in the benefi ts associated with a particular target. However, losing qualitative dimensions means that important aspects of realising the full dimensions of the goal are lost.Some aspects of this eff ect are illustrated in a study of South Africa\\'s response to MDG 3. The indicators associated with the target for MDG 3-to eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education-have been met. 9, 48 South Africa has achieved gender parity in primary net enrolment ratio, the proportion of boys and girls who complete 5 years of primary schooling, and in literacy rates in young adults. More young women are in secondary and tertiary education than are young men. But these achievements against the indicators provide only a small insight into the broader goal.Interviews undertaken with offi cials in the national Department of Education and a provincial Ministry in 2008 and 2009 as part of the Gender, Education and Global Poverty Reduction Initiatives research project indicated that South Africa was proud of having met the quantitative targets for gender parity, but that for several offi cials this was suffi cient achievement on gender issues, and that other areas should get more priority. 49 Schools are assumed to promote equity simply by having achieved parity, and so their complicity in perpetuating inequitable gender relations often goes unacknowledged. As a result, data from the Gender, Education and Global Poverty Reduction Initiatives project indicate that teachers and government offi cials locate the source of gender problems in the family, both in terms of blame and responsibility for fi nding solutions.However, several studies document how, despite policy declarations which stress the importance of gender and race equality, South African schools are sites of gender discrimination. 50 This discrimination is manifest in school regimes that do not question, but in fact reproduce, norms associated with male achievement and female subordination. The diffi culties for teachers in using the curriculum to question and change these assumptions are compounded by employment practices, which often make it diffi cult for women, who make up a large part of the teaching profession, to gain promotion. 51 Although the HIV epidemic off ered many opportunities for schools to engage in refl ection on questions of sex and gender, and some creative engagements emerged, it was often very diffi cult to challenge deeply-held assumptions. Many studies identify practices of gender-based violence in schools or associated with teachers and the policy challenges that these entail. [52] [53] [54] Clearly education policy concerned with promotion of greater equality needs to recognise the ways in which schooling encourages inequitable gendered relations and the ways in which policies and practices might themselves constitute gender relationships. Working with the MDG framework means that a country can have fulfi lled the target, but this does not always achieve the spirit of the goal.\\n\\nEquity\\n\\nThe issue of equity arose in the analysis of most MDG sectors. It is a central issue that has its roots in the initial formulation of the MDGs as poverty reduction and development goals targeted at poor countries, rather than global goals created for all countries. Issues of inequity within the MDG framework are not obvious, but they could be the most serious shortcoming of the MDGs because they associate the MDGs with minimally ameliorating major areas of need for a proportion of the population, rather than diminishing the major gaps between wealthy and poor people, both within and between countries, in ways that benefi t everyone.In this context, inequity means inequality that is unfair. Fraser 70 developed an expansive notion of gender equity that goes considerably beyond equality. She associates equity with practices that confer dignity for all, and that are against poverty, exploitation, marginalisation, and misogyny. Additionally, these practices entail fairness in relation to income and leisure time. This defi nition alerts us to inequity as a process that entails not simply assessing amounts of a particular health, income, or education goods, but also paying careful attention to the relationships associated with distribution. The MDGs enable us to focus on access to minimum levels of provision in health, education, or earnings, but they do not go far enough to address unfair social relations associated with crossing a line of minimum adequacy.Part of the diffi culty in making targets go far enough is the way in which inequity is measured. Inequity is usually described in economic terms, most frequently as wealth quintiles, based on possessions owned by the household. 71 This is a convenient approach that can be applied to information such as the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data to analyse income or consumption. In many settings, wealth quintiles eff ectively indicate other inequities within a society. They draw attention to diff erences in key markers of access and outcome between those who do and do not have material assets, which provide a mechanism to examine diff erences between countries in terms of how these assets are distributed. Some specifi c measures of inequalities in wealth have been developed, such as the Gini coeffi cient which measures the extent to which distribution of wealth is uneven. Other measures are the ratio of the incomes of the richest 10% or 20% of the population compared with the poorest 10% or 20%. 72 The use of wealth quintiles as a means to measure equity has featured explicitly in only one MDG target, MDG 1 target 1A, for which indicators include measurement of a poverty gap ratio (between lowest and highest wealth quintiles) and the share of the poorest quintile in national consumption. However, wealth quintiles have been used extensively in analyses of healthrelated MDGs undertaken by the World Bank, UNICEF, and others, 73,74 and very recently in work into the distribution of education enrolment rates. 9 But wealth, income, or consumption are not the only features of inequity. Factors such as geography and ethnic origin might be more important in identifi cation of inequities, both in access and outcome of health interventions. 75 In rural Papua New Guinea and Ethiopia, the most important determinant of access to health care, and health outcomes, may be geography. Asset indices do not always predict health outcomes. In some settings, geography, ethnic origin, or other factors might be more dominant factors. But the absence of measures that capture these other factors across diff erent societies means that these features of inequity in distribution are overlooked.Importantly, asset indices cannot inform us about the gender dynamics of wealth distribution within a household or a community. 76 Many household studies in developing countries show how little access women have to household resources. 77 This defi cit comes into sharp focus when the household is faced with an emergency, particularly a health emergency. The outcome of such an emergency, especially when children are involved, is strongly aff ected by the extent of women\\'s empowerment within a community. 76 Several studies in high-income countries show that inequality is often associated with other social ills. Wilkinson and Pickett 78 associate inequality in income with a range of aspects of ill health, such as low life expectancy, mental health problems, and obesity, and markers of social dislocation such as violence and imprisonment. They argue that societies with large gaps between rich and poor people have adverse consequences for everyone, including those who earn well. Their work and many other large-scale review studies on equalities 79 suggest that inequity means much more than inequality in income levels.The notion of equity has a universal assumption in that it benefi ts all people, not just the disadvantaged sections of society. Preservation of inequity or lack of distribution for some, while addressing suffi ciency or better for others, is not the way to maximise benefi ts for a society. Many of the targets associated with the MDGs focus on improving conditions for some, but not addressing wellbeing for all. This inequity is the case for all targets that focus on changing the proportion of people experiencing a particular hardship-eg, reducing the maternal mortality ratio or the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day. Even when these MDG targets are achieved, a proportion of the population would remain below a line of adequacy and the inequities within a society would not be resolved. Reduction of the number of people living on $1 a day or less will relieve some people from extreme poverty, but only just. If action is directed only at those near the threshold, the eff ect might be to increase inequity, pulling those accessible populations across the poverty line, thereby widening the gap between them and those still below the threshold. The fundamental inequities in income distribution will remain and will continue to erode the foundation of society.The MDG approach has led to a social policy that has focused on the easiest way to bring particular groups just above a poverty line relating to income levels, school enrolment, etc. This approach has been benefi cial for some populations, but still leaves problems of marginalisation, poverty, inequality, and little dignity for many people whose specifi c circumstances often disappear in aggregated reporting on MDG achievement. For example, in India in 2005, children achieved an average 7·5 years in school, nearly completing a cycle of primary and elementary education. Children from the richest quintile, both boys and girls, completed on average 11 years of schooling, whereas boys from the poorest quintile completed 5 years of schooling, and girls completed only 3 years. 9 Thus, although India was on track to meet the MDG 2 target, inequities in educational opportunities were being perpetuated between diff erent population groups, and between the sexes. For MDG 7, improvements in access to improved sanitation are substantial, but are also strongly associated with the wealthiest quintiles of the population. 4 Health interventions associated with MDGs 4, 5, and 6 are mainly applied through established health services, tending to favour the same individuals who have been covered by previous interventions. They might live near the road or the health post, have relatives who have been trained as health workers, or have access to information. Those who are both geographically and socially far away from the rest of the population do not receive the intervention. A district level study 80 of child mortality in Tanzania since 1988 draws attention to the fact that in a poor African country that has made admirable progress towards child survival, there is substantial variability in the progress made, and the districts that were doing well in 1988 improved at a greater rate than did the poorer districts. Thus the improved child survival that Tanzania has recorded has been at the expense of worsening geographical inequity. 80 In education, many countries have expanded access to primary education through abolishment of school fees (eg, Mozambique, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya); however, this intervention has not always meant that all costs associated with schooling are lifted from poor parents or that high-quality education is delivered. Indeed, in many countries the poorest children have the least qualifi ed and supported teachers. Often the language of instruction at school used by teachers is not the same as that which children speak at home. Families struggle to meet the hidden costs of schooling-eg, costs associated with clothing, transport, or additional tuition. 9 Free education is not necessarily associated with improved equity since other factors, such as attitudes of blame,The analysis in part 2 drew attention to inequity as a major problem arising from the formulation of some MDG goals, targets, and indicators. To go beyond these shortcomings, we see equity and fairness as a key principle for future development goal setting. Equity expresses some of the values associated with justice which we see as intrinsic to the notion of development that we have elaborated. Sen has argued that aspects of equality, whether these are related to rights to hold property, vote, or earn the same level of income, are a core component of ideas about justice in the contemporary world. 105 Although diff erences might exist with regard to what type of equality is valued or emphasised, equality in some space is a central aspiration, and the notion of equity distils the types of social relations entailed in ensuring this aim. Drawing on changing meanings of the word equity in English from the 14th century, Unterhalter 106 has identifi ed three diff erent levels of equity comprising equity from above, which needs a fair system of institutional arrangements; equity from below, which entails processes of participation and discussion; and equity from the middle, which ensures the effi cient fl ow of services, information, and investment. All three are necessary and complement each other, emphasising aspects of holism discussed in the previous section.Equity is often discussed in terms of equity of opportunity or outcome. Ensuring equity of opportunity is often associated with putting in place the institutional arrangements for managed provision of health, education, or employment services. In an economy, these services and opportunities provide employment or provide credit for investment in producing goods to generate income. In education, they include providing appropriately sited schools, making universal opportunities for school attendance, and access to the curriculum through an appropriate language policy and training suffi cient teachers. In health, provision of these services means building suffi cient health facilities, training staff , and ensuring a supply of drugs. For the environment, it means providing access to clean water and air, and harvestable natural resources resulting from the Equity of outcome provides an alternative assessment of whether personal heterogeneities have been considered in relation to health, education, or poverty elimination. Processes that can help to secure this entail attention to participation in the evaluation of services, concern with aff ordability, and adaptability of services to meet diverse circumstances. A principle of equity in development goal settings needs, therefore, to address equity of both opportunity and outcome. Achievement of a level of wellbeing for all people will need the development of a more equitable world, built on more equitable societies in which there are adequate fl ows of information, understanding, resources, training, and respect to enable diverse individuals to attain a decent quality of life. The principle of equity applies across generations (including elderly, middle aged, and young people, children, and unborn babies, and thus incorporates sustainability) and within generations (eg, across nations, social groups, and gender).Equity requires a focus on the needs of each community or country, and the particular historical, geographic, linguistic, or gender dimensions of inequity. A simple approach to this requirement in goal setting is to build into survey instruments the variables needed to analyse the true determinants of inequity in health, learning, food security, and other outcomes. These variables will usually be seen as economic (wealth quintiles), geographic (distance from a functioning service-eg, health facility or school), ethnic (belonging to a deprived or discriminated ethnic group), age-related (children, young families, elderly people), or associated with gender (touching on distributional issues inside the family and capacity to participate in the labour market or decisionmaking bodies). Information has to be disaggregated so that inequity in one parameter is not obscured by another. Once the most appropriate variable, or variables, have been identifi ed for a specifi c country, they can be incorporated into access, process, and outcome indicators and can then be monitored, both as national averages, and as markers of trends to reduce inequities.To ensure equitable outcomes, assessing equity also entails establishing processes for improved participation in collective public discussions and decision making concerning not only aspects of learning and health provision, but also all areas that aff ect people\\'s wellbeing. These include global, national, and local economic policy and political issues at all levels, and are related to the principles of ownership and obligation.\\n\\nPanel 4: National implementation of MDGs in Malawi\\n\\nMalawi has been orienting its development activities towards the achievement of the MDGs. This shift is evident from the development strategies that have been formulated by the government, the articulation of the development strategy in the budget process, and the commitment to monitor progress on the indicators of the MDGs.The MDGs in Malawi are implemented through a medium-term development strategy known as the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy for 2006-11; its overall goal is to reduce poverty through sustainable economic growth and infrastructure development. The strategy focuses on six key priority areas: agriculture and food security; irrigation and water development; transport infrastructure development; energy generation and supply; integrated rural development; and prevention and management of nutrition disorders and HIV/AIDS. 57 There is a clear articulation about how the focus on these six priority areas is to contribute to the achievement of the MDGs. The budget framework is also fully aligned to the strategy, and by implication to the achievement of the MDGs, by being framed in such a way that it refl ects expenditure allocations to pro-poor sectors in Malawi.Since 2006, Malawi has been monitoring its progress towards the achievement of the MDGs and assessment of the possibility of achieving the targets by 2020. The Government of Malawi, through the Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation, publishes the Malawi MDGs report every year. The most recent 2008 Malawi MDGs report documents remarkable progress in many areas and projects that some of the goals are likely to be achieved by 2020. Progress has been registered in eradication of extreme poverty (MGD 1); reduction of child mortality (MGD 4); and combating of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases (MDG 6); while daunting challenges remain in improving maternal health, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equality, and empowerment of women. In terms of achieving the MDGs, the recent assessment shows that Malawi is likely to meet the 2020 target for MDGs 1, 4, 6, and 7, while MDGs 3 and 5 are unlikely to be met and MDG 2 is potentially feasible. 58The very substantial progress that has been made in MDG 1 in reduction of the proportion of the population in extreme poverty from 53·9% in 2000 to 45% in 2006 has been achieved because of several interventions-eg, the implementation of the agricultural input subsidy, introduction of social support programmes for vulnerable groups, pro-poor allocation of public expenditures, and macroeconomic management leading to positive economic growth rates in the past 5 years. These interventions have been assisted by good weather and high tobacco prices, and high political will to implement pro-poor programmes. The implementation of the agricultural input subsidy has enabled the country to produce more food, with the stunting and wasting of children younger than 5 years falling from 6·4% and 6·8%, respectively, in 2005, to 4·9% and 5·8% in 2007. Poverty reduction and food security have been at the centre of the political and development agenda of the country, and MDG 1 has added impetus to the implementation of programmes aimed at reducing poverty in the country.distancing, or marginalisation, maintain existing inequities. 81 Although some countries have worked to improve the provision of education to the poorest groups through a focus on improved teacher quality, better learning materials, and social assistance, realisation of this policy remains a challenge, particularly in schools for the poorest children. [82] [83] [84] Thus the MDGs promote an approach that might systematically exclude individuals at highest risk, achieving improvements on indicators by focusing on those populations that are easiest to reach. This is not a new occurrence. Even before the appearance of the MDGs, for example, most countries that made substantial gains in child survival between the 1980s and the 1990s achieved these gains at the expense of increasing inequity, since successive interventions targeted and excluded the same groups of children as before. 85, 86 The approach underpinning the MDGs and their targets for poverty, education, gender, health, and the environment is the attainment of a specifi c minimum standard for a proportion of the world\\'s people. There are other possible approaches that would be more equitable. For example, the target might be fully adequate provision for all, taking account for particular heterogeneities, or it might be narrowing of the gap between the most privileged and the most deprived, ensuring that no group is below a level of adequacy. A deliberate, pro-poor or human rights approach can be taken, actively addressing inequities and realising rights for the poorest people. Some countries, such as Peru, have deliberately adopted a pro-poor approach to child-survival strategies. 87 Unfortunately, such countries are the exception.In conclusion, the present MDG framework does not address inequity by maintaining a concern with just adequate provision for some, ignoring the needs of those who are too hard to reach and not addressing the diffi culties of inequality in societies that seem to have deleterious consequences for everyone, not only the poorest people. More equitable MDG targets would not only help those near the threshold, but could direct improved, rather than minimal, resources at the poorest groups.\\n\\nPart 3: framing of future development goals Introduction\\n\\nThe MDGs have had a substantial eff ect, both with respect to focusing resources and eff orts on important development objectives, and also more generally in raising public and political interest in the development agenda, engaging for the fi rst time a wide range of sectors and disciplines in a concerted eff ort. As we approach the UN Summit on Sept 20-22, 2010, the two-thirds mark towards the target date for the MDGs, attention is focused on the achievement of existing goals. But there is also much interest in what happens after 2015. Many diff erent views have been expressed about that future. Sumner 88 has suggested three broad options: (1) continue with the same MDGs, with or without a timeline (Sachs has argued for 2025); 89 (2) create new targets, perhaps locally defi ned, with or without a timeline; or (3) combine the MDGs with something new (ie, an inner core of the existing MDGs, but add new and locally defi ned targets as an outer core).Manning has responded to what happens after 2015 by emphasising the need to move beyond confl ating development with aid and to recognise the eff ect of global factors and changing international power structures. 3 The Chronic Poverty Report of 2008-09 argues for a new development agenda to include access to basic social protection for all poor and vulnerable people by 2020, universal access to post-primary education by 2020, and leading to the elimination of absolute poverty by 2025. 90 In the fi nal section of this report, we apply our cross-MDG, cross-sectoral comparison to consider the future of development goals. Hence we focus on what might come after the MDGs, in view of the MDG experience. This is not to belittle in any way the importance of trying to achieve the existing MDGs in the next 5 years. Our premise is that, whether or not present MDGs are continued, modifi ed, or replaced after 2015, we should move forward having learned the lessons of the previous 15 years, and addressed any weaknesses that have become apparent in MDGs. In part 1, we examined individual MDGs and identifi ed their specifi c challenges, which we used in part 2 to draw out common challenges that cut across the goals. We found that the core challenges relate to reducing gaps and fragmentation in the MDGs, enhancing their integration, improving targeting and indicators, and ensuring equity and ownership. The reasons for fragmentation, incoherence, and gaps in the existing MDGs lie in their origins; although they included goals from a range of sectors, a common, cross-sectoral vision of development was not the basis for their formulation. Rather, as we have noted in part 1, the specifi c goals that emerged from the MDG formulation process were largely targets established in independent, earlier sectoral initiatives, grouped together and edited for political sensitivity, to maximise broad international support. Looking forward, we consider that any project after 2015 should be built on a coherent and shared approach to development, which can guide action across diff erent sectors including, but not confi ned to, addressing poverty, inequity, and environmental degradation, and improving gender equity, education, and health.\\n\\nDefi nition of development\\n\\nDevelopment is an ambiguous, multifaceted, and contested notion that in diff erent contexts and to diff erent people can describe aspirations, outcomes, or processes concerned with wider political, social, or economic change. Diff erent development approaches vary in their emphasis on these diff erent elements of developmenteg, on economic growth, modernisation, or structural change-and in their understandings of the natures of, and relations between, means and ends. Anand and Sen draw attention to helpful distinctions between ends (eg, wellbeing, freedom, and capabilities or expanded choices) and means (eg, wealth and economic growth), 91 in line, for example, with Habermas\\'s 92 diff erentiation between human forms of communication and solidarity on the one hand and highly rationalised demands for economic effi ciency on the other. They also emphasise the importance of considering universal intergenerational and intragenerational distribution together, to examine the potential for both complementary synergies (eg, in investments in maternal health and in education) and the competition for resources (eg, between present and future consumption) in discussions of sustainable development. Development invokes concerns with normative aspiration, process, and practice, which generally entail assessment.We have already considered how diff erent elements of the MDGs are compatible with, and indeed are derived from, diff erent conceptualisations of development. The MDGs are fragmented not only in their implementation but also in their underlying conceptualisations of development and overlapping of means and ends. Thus economic growth is considered in MDG 1 (or at least in the dominant concept that economic growth is the key driver of poverty reduction); MDGs 2-6 are more concerned with basic needs and human development (although MDG 3 focuses on a particular end regarding one aspect of equity); MDG 7 is concerned with both environmental sustainability and basic needs (of sanitation and urban dwellings); whereas MDG 8 mainly addresses structural issues in international trading and fi nancial systems and relations (although targets measure these in terms of Offi cial Development Assistance [ODA] fl ows, tariff s and subsidies aff ecting trade, and debt relief). While this approach captures a range of development perspectives, it generates a poorly aligned mixture of means, ends, and sometimes competing ideas about normative aspiration (eg, economic growth vs sustainability), which has made the MDG project less useful than it could have been, since opportunities to link the goals together coherently have been missed and a rigorous approach to assessment has been overlooked.Building on both our cross-sectoral analysis of the MDGs and other multidimensional understandings of development concerned with economic growth, livelihoods, entitlements and capabilities, equity, environmental and ecosystem services, and institutions, 93,94 we put forward an overarching conceptualisation of development that derives from an assessment of existing choices, and a clearer articulation of the relation of ends In 1992, Zambia began implementing Health Sector Reform, with the vision to \"provide the people of Zambia with equity of access to cost-eff ective, quality healthcare as close to the family as possible\" guided by the NHSP. Although the 2001-05 NHSP reaffi rmed the health vision, principles, and overall health goals of the Health Sector Reforms, 61 the theme adopted for the 2006-10 NHSP was entitled \"Towards the Attainment of the Millennium Development Goals and National Health Priorities\", indicating close alignment with the MDGs. 62 This alignment is refl ected in the fact that seven of the 12 national health priorities focused on public health priorities whereas fi ve directly addressed the three health MDGs. 63 However, although these priority areas were specifi cally singled out for special attention, the NHSP did include other health-care interventions.Zambia\\'s strategic alignment with the MDGs has benefi ted from the increased donor support for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria that was received in the fi rst decade of the 21st century. The availability of fi nancial and technical resources from donors such as the Global Fund, the President\\'s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the World Bank\\'s Zambia National Response to HIV/AIDS (ZANARA) programme, among others, underpinned to a large extent the progress that has been documented towards attainment of MDG 6 directly. Particularly striking has been the progress made towards achievement of universal access to treatment for HIV/AIDS for all those who need it. By the end of 2008, 200 435 adults were estimated to be receiving antiretroviral drugs, representing 66·3% of the estimated need. 63 However, although the prevalence of HIV fell slightly to 14·3% in 2007 64 compared with 15·6% in 2002, 65 the results of the 2009 epidemiological synthesis study suggest continued transmission of infection, with 1·6% of the adult population becoming newly infected every year. 66 This fi nding implies that to get close to attainment of the 2015 targets there needs to be a renewed focus on prevention of new infections. The National Prevention Strategy articulates the key drivers of the epidemic in Zambia and will guide the prevention eff orts in the next 5 years. 67 Overall, the 2008 National Progress Report on the MDGs suggests that, with the exception of MDG 7, the country is likely or potentially likely to attain the MDGs by 2015. 68 However, continued reliance on external donor support implies that the sector is vulnerable to the global economic climate, as has been experienced in 2009. The ability to maintain any gains in health indicators after 2015 needs planning that will target the long-term sustainable development of the economy. and means. Hence, we are seeking to make operational some of the ideas that Amartya Sen outlines in The Idea of Justice. 95 Sen\\'s argument is that elaboration of a vision of global justice at the present moment, when there are no appropriate institutions to deliver this vision, might be deemed an exercise in ideal theory; however, it is nonetheless important to focus on the choices that are actually on off er in a globally inter-related world, the plurality of principles and inter pretations that might play a part in view of the diff erent histories and contexts of people, and the permissibility of partial resolutions (ie, that making some things a bit better rather than waiting for the best resolution) could be an important step. Sen also emphasises public reasoning and attention to assessment of human lives in terms of capabilitiesie, reasoned values and the signifi cance accorded by these factors.Drawing from this method of assessment of existing human relationships, and identifi cation of means and ends, we defi ne development as a dynamic process involving sustainable and equitable access to improved wellbeing. This conceptualisation needs brief elaboration. There are many elements of wellbeing and increasing published work on its application and measurement. 92, 96, 97 Sen views wellbeing as a combination of the aspiration that \"human lives can go much better\" and an understanding that improvement can be brought about through a strengthening of human agency, a person\\'s capability to pursue and realise things that he or she values and has reason to value. 98 Unlike conventional economics that equate wellbeing with happiness, Sen\\'s capability approach suggests that aspects of wellbeing have to consider the things that we really value (whether they make us happy or not) and levels of deprivation, whether or not people report they are happy despite severe want. By suggesting that wellbeing is linked with capabilities-that is the freedom to enjoy various combinations of beings and doings-Sen draws attention to the signifi cance of how diff erent people necessarily have need of and make use of resources in diverse ways. 97 To consider heterogeneity as part of any evaluation of the freedom people have is therefore crucial. Social arrangements for development are thus to be assessed not in the space of resources (inputs) or of outcomes (happiness) but in relation to wellbeing, agency, and capabilities-that is the freedom to promote and achieve functionings that people value. In adoption of an understanding of wellbeing that derives from Sen\\'s ideas, we defi ne wellbeing as the freedoms and capability to make choices and act eff ectively with respect to, for example, health, education, nutrition, employment, security, participation, voice, consumption, and the claiming of rights. For each of these elements of wellbeing, there are important considerations of quality and quantity of achievement, of diversity in aspirations between diff erent communities, of equity, and in some of these aspects (most notably those concerned with material consumption) of the need to recognise satisfaction from suffi cient (as opposed to maximised) achievement, as diminishing marginal returns to consumption are overtaken by increasing marginal costs (including social costs). This approach helps access to improved wellbeing to be both equitable and sustainable. In this section we will discuss the nature and implications of equity and sustainability, but note here their importance as intrinsic features of our development notion.Sustainable and equitable improvements in wellbeing are achieved by expanding access to services that deliver the diff erent elements of wellbeing. The classifi cation of services provided by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 99 is particularly useful, since it makes a distinction between moderating (or regulating), provisioning, supportive, and cultural services. This typology has wider applicability beyond the provision of The printed journal includes an image merely for illustration ecosystem services by natural capital (eg, forests, soils, wetlands, oceans). Thus physical capital (eg, infrastructure and equipment), human capital (eg, knowledge, skills, labour), and social capital (eg, institutions, relationships) all generate moderating (or regulatory) services that provide stability, promote resilience, and reduce systems\\' sensitivity to change. Similarly, these diff erent types of capital also generate provisioning or productive services (producing goods and services for direct or indirect consumption), supporting services (supporting conditions necessary for and underpinning systems\\' existence and functioning), and cultural services (which provide communicative, aesthetic, recreational, or spiritual benefi ts). Finally, development has to be explicitly and fundamentally seen as a dynamic process of change. This view involves a plurality of perspectives with several stakeholders, who interact as individuals within and between households, organisations, communities, and nations, with diff ering resources and aspirations. Embedded and emergent properties in systems operating at these diff erent scales mean that changes and transformations within them are interdependent and highly complex. 93 This conceptualisation of development extends beyond that implicit in the MDGs, for which MDGs 1-6 in particular are focused on poverty reduction and the achievement of limited, indeed minimalist, standards of welfare, 13 with little emphasis on wider notions of development or on the condition of people who are not affl icted by extreme poverty. Our notion addresses issues that need commitment and action across countries of low, middle, and high income. In view of the arbitrary nature of the cutoff points in many classifi cations of poor and non-poor people, and the moral arguments that all people have an equal right to aspire to much more than escape from narrow and arbitrarily defi ned levels of poverty, we believe that development goals should extend beyond, but include, minimalist poverty reduction and survival goals.Our notion also diff ers from the MDGs in another way. Gore 13, 100 has suggested that the development of the present MDGs represented a switch from a procedural approach to development (involving common respect for rules, norms, and practices governing relations) to a distinctly purposive approach, involving the achievement of specifi c, agreed outcomes. Our notion incorporates both of these elements-it is purposive in that it identifi es elements of wellbeing as targets to be achieved, and it is procedural in that it places strong emphasis on equitable, sustainable, owned, and scaled processes. Importantly, it adopts a holistic, maximalist approach while recognising that minimalist standards have a role.However, this broader conceptualisation of development could threaten a core feature of the MDGs that has allowed them, individually and collectively, to achieve a high degree of international consensus and commitment. Only by limiting the scope of the MDGs and accepting gaps resulting from the omission of politically sensitive issues could parsimony and broad agreement be reached. Further, this agreement was reached building on some of the optimistic realignments of the 1990s in the aftermath of the end of the Cold War as a centralised process led by more powerful players with a pragmatic acceptance of the lowest common set of goals and indicators, defi ned to allow sometimes loose and sometimes narrow interpretations. However, any future project to develop the MDGs will be located in a very diff erent global political economy characterised by the events after Sept 11, 2001 , the emergence of a new security agenda, the eff ects of the fi nancial crises, the emergence of China and India as signifi cant economic and geopolitical players, and extreme caution about what global agreements can achieve in view of the failures of the Doha round on trade agreements and the Copenhagen conference on climate change.Building on a broader notion of development should therefore recognise this history and address the dilemma posed by likely trade-off s between a comprehensive set of development goals, and comprehensive commitment to these goals. This approach will not be easy, but several development issues make the MDGs\\' focus on a set of goals aimed at increasing the material consumption of poor people less tenable. We draw attention to, for example, a growing acceptance of the need to address population growth, to recognise and restrict the environmental eff ect of human activities, and to understand the limitations of growth based on capitalism and neo-liberalism as a system for delivery of sustainable development. These issues have been ones for which comprehensive agreement is diffi cult to obtain from states with diff erent ideologies and political systems, but they can no longer be avoided. Unterhalter and Carpentier 101 set out this challenge in terms of a so-called development tetralemma faced in the pursuit of mechanisms and systems that simultaneously promote equity, growth, democracy, and sustainability (in which a tetralemma is defi ned as analogous to a dilemma, but involving a set of four crucially important options for which each is necessary but not suffi cient for sustainable development, and they cannot all be achieved together). Almost all present political and economic mechanisms and systems can only achieve some of these at the expense of others; hence they are compromised even in their initial achievements. Experience of the Copenhagen negotiations in December, 2009, on climate change targets and measures shows the diffi culties in getting international agreements on complex and politically sensitive issues aff ecting international and intergenerational investments and concerned with countries\\' diff ering and evolving domestic aspirations and perceptions of rights and responsibilities. 102, 103 Guiding principles for development goalsWe suggest that a more comprehensive concept for development should and can form the basis of a development project after 2015, if that project follows fi ve guiding principles. We derive these principles from our development notion above, and from our analysis in part 2 of the MDGs\\' strengths and weaknesses. They are: holism, equity, sustainability, ownership, and global obligation. We examine each of these in turn, but emphasise that they are not independent of each other, but closely interwoven.\\n\\nHolism\\n\\nBy holism we mean the need to avoid gaps in a development agenda and realise synergies between its components. We emphasised in part 2 of this report both gaps in the MDGs and the way that their separation contributes to a failure to achieve integration and synergy between the elements that contribute to improved wellbeing. Figure 1 shows how this tenet can be viewed in terms of three core dimensions of wellbeing. It suggests that people\\'s wellbeing and capabilities depend on human development (change in their individual human conditions and resources), social development (change in their social relations and resources), and environmental development (change in their access to and relations with natural and environmental resources). Progress on each of these areas is crucial for people\\'s wellbeing, but they are also closely related to and dependent on each other. A formulation of development goals should start from these individual and interlinked dimensions. We also note that achievement of human, social, and environmental development as set out in fi gure 1 is dependent on underpinning development of physical capital and, in view of the global challenges noted earlier, population stabilisation. Neither of these are themselves core dimensions of wellbeing, but both are important for human, social, and environmental development.The general identifi cation of human, social, and environmental development as core dimensions for achievement of wellbeing is important for a holistic conceptualisation of development processes and outcomes, but it is too broad to be a practicable focus for development policy and action. For this approach we need to consider more specifi c elements that are necessary means and ends to achieve contributors to human, social, and environmental development and, as a result, wellbeing. These factors could be confi gured in many ways. By means of illustration, we present one set in fi gure 2.Some of these elements clearly resemble existing MDGs. Some are presented diff erently to address some of the weaknesses that we have identifi ed in the MDGseg, the lack of focus on learning, and the lack of the integration of health areas. Others represent areas excluded from the MDGs, such as human rights. An important feature of each of these elements is that it contributes directly or indirectly to human, social, and environmental development. The elements are holistic and interlinked and represent areas in which we can realistically in Sen\\'s terms \"do more and do better\". 104 Access to water, for example, delivers human, social, and environmental elements of wellbeing, through water for drinking and sanitation, societal agreements on water sharing and use, and sustainable use of watersheds and management of pollution, respectively.The absence of explicit reference to economic development or growth or to markets from fi gures 1 and 2 is not intended to suggest that economic growth is not important in development. Indeed it is crucial for funding investments in the delivery of services for most of the elements in fi gure 2, and underpins participation in and enjoyment of livelihoods (and employment) by which people both contribute to and access services from the local and wider communities of which they are a part. However, the dimensions and elements of development in fi gures 1 and 2 are higher level development ends, in whose pursuit economic development and growth are important means. Furthermore, the importance, nature, and extent of economic growth, and the roles of markets, governments, and other institutions (eg, civil society) in achievement of these ends are context specifi c. Thus growth is less important in more wealthy economies, where more attention might be needed for issues of sustainability and reducing the negative eff ects of material consumption on the environment. In poorer economies, however, economic growth is likely to be more important.We present the elements in fi gure 2 as indicative. They might not describe all the essential elements contributing to wellbeing, or they could be confi gured or combined better-any changes or additions need to be considered in a similarly interlinked approach. Further, we do not propose these elements as a list of future MDGs. In view of experience so far, expansion of MDGs from eight to 13, and adding the targets and indicators that achieved the linkages intended, might considerably weaken the virtue Overarching ends Dimensions of parsimony in attracting public attention and fi nancial investment (although the pursuit of synergies might also allow some reduction in targets per goal).Prioritisation would be a process with a strong political element, as with the existing MDGs. We emphasise here that any selection of priorities for targeting should be done through an approach that identifi es the elements that deliver most human, social, and environmental development, and, in subselecting from these elements, recognise and accommodate as best as possible the gaps that will arise and the linkages that such gaps might threaten. We suggest that this approach would be better than assembling specifi c, independent goals to make a development agenda, as was done with the present MDGs, with retrospective fi lling in of gaps and making of linkages-a process that has had limited success because of complexity and lack of ownership.Another aspect of a holistic approach to development goal setting concerns operational choices in delivery of services. In this approach, holism suggests that there has to be the opportunity for co-action across elements and synergies in relation to service access for individuals and communities. The absence of this, for example, with interventions in health in one part of a country and interventions in education in another, could contribute to marginal, sectoral increases in wellbeing, but fail to capture the added gains from joint investments in education and health in the same groups of people (eg, improved health services reduce children\\'s absences from school and improve their participation and concentration at school, while education can improve uptake of health services).However, we realise that one practical consequence of this operational application of the principle of holism might be a potential confl ict with our principle of equity.Undertaking a series of intervention programmes addressing diff erent areas for action in the same localities with the same households could yield large benefi ts for these households and communities. However, it would be unfair and inequitable if at the same time other poor localities missed out on all interventions because resources were insuffi cient. Thus, to continue with our example above, added investment in education in one part of the country and added investment in health in another might seem to be more equitable, but such equity might be achieved at the cost of losses in eff ectiveness and effi ciency. Nonetheless, working with Sen\\'s advocacy of partial resolutions submitted for public scrutiny might allow for these rationales to be assessed. 94 \\n\\nSustainability\\n\\nSustainability was not explicitly or implicitly addressed in the MDGs, apart from in MDG 7 from the perspective of environmental sustainability and sustainable development. These two diff erent notions-the fi rst relating to protection of ecosystem function and services, and the second to economic growth that protects the opportunities of future generations 107 -are important features of a comprehensive development concept. However, sustainable wellbeing is broader than both these ideas.We defi ne sustainability of a system that delivers an outcome, such as wellbeing, in terms of its capacity to persist, and to resist or recover from shocks that aff ect its productivity. 108 Sustainability is an important feature of the diff erent development dimensions and elements identifi ed earlier; economic and fi nancial sustainability arises particularly from processes of social development, and from human and environmental development. Sustainable action should be a practice of all stakeholders who have power over the resources a system uses, and it will apply to all scales (eg, from households to nations, from fi elds and small stream catchments to river basins). Such sustainable action is hard to achieve, but is made easier when diff erent services can substitute for each other to improve sustainability. For example, the sustainability of nutrition as an element of wellbeing can be supported by development of improved agricultural and environmental systems, by improved trade and the equitable distribution of foodstuff s, or by changes in personal livelihoods or behaviour that give individuals more reserves to survive periods of want. And sustainable wellbeing depends on children and young people learning how to learn in order to make full use of improved agricultural, environmental, and distribution systems, and to develop resistance to shocks in health and income in the future.A broad but clear understanding of the role of productivity is crucial to understand sustainability. Productivity needs to be defi ned in terms of a system\\'s delivery of the provisioning, supportive, regulating, and cultural services that we discussed earlier. Not only does productivity have to be viable in material terms (not depleting resources below stocks needed for the system to operate), it also has to be both viable and acceptable in social and economic terms. Therefore, all stakeholders with (formal or informal) control over resources need to have the ability and incentives to support the maintenance of the system. We draw attention to two implications from this tenet. First, growth in productivity is crucial for the sustainability of many systems, but not a necessary feature of all systems, and the nature and rate of growth needed in a system will vary with the aspirations of stakeholders, changing pressures on systems, and socioeconomic structures and relations. Thus increasing population and aspirations for substantial improvements in wellbeing for poor people makes strong demands for productivity growth, but economic growth associated with increases in material consumption will not be as important for some advanced economies and their sustainability. This notion brings us back to our discussion in part 2 of this report of targets and the important, but widely misunderstood, distinction between global and national targets. Although the sustainability of the planet needs substantial reductions in productivity growth globally, the poorest countries might need to achieve high productivity growth to raise the incomes of the poorest. Second, both equity and ownership are needed in the management of systems and the returns that they off er to diff erent stakeholders. Failure of crucial stakeholders to perceive that they or others benefi t fairly from a system will lead to their withdrawal of resources from that system and its eventual collapse. The requirements of sustainability are therefore inextricably linked with our other principles of holism, equity, ownership, and global obligation.\\n\\nGlobal obligation\\n\\nThe experience of 10 years of work on the MDGs raises serious issues for debate about global justice, both as an important area of normative discussion and in terms of institution building and practical politics. Commitment to the MDGs implicitly or explicitly involved commitments to large transfers of resources from developed to developing economies and, in MDG 8, commitments to address inequities in structural relations between countries. However, despite delivery of the resources needed to achieve some MDGs, relations between developed and developing countries are largely characterised by unmet political and fi nancial commitments from developed countries. These commitments can be attributed to a failure by political leaders and voters to recognise and own international development obligations.The question of what the nature of our obligation is to people who are not citizens of our country raises a range of complex philosophical and political challenges. 111, 112 In a particular country citizens share a government and many political, economic, cultural, and social relationships that make up everyday life. The areas of MDG focus-income, nutrition, education, health provision, water, and housing-are all areas that became the focus of state policy and practical intervention in the 20th century. Thus governments became a key locus of obligation for social protection.But there is also a long history of civil society concern with people who live beyond national borders. Global ties of affi liation take in members (or intended members) of a particular faith community, and members of a group connected by attachment to a common language or set of practices. Links beyond local or national boundaries also have connected people aff ected by particular global economic injustices, such as slavery or racism, and those who have been outraged at its practices. Women, who are often discriminated against in their own societies, express the view that they share more with women in other societies than they do their own. This view is polemically captured in Virginia Woolf\\'s statement written in the mid-1930s: \"As a woman I have no country. As a woman my country is the whole world.\"The question of the nature of global obligation in the contemporary world with regard to specifi c present MDG areas (eg, education, health, gender equality) has been much debated, [113] [114] [115] with positions ranging from the need to emphasise national priorities and processes to concerns to establish some intermixture of national decision making and global review that preserves a perspective on adequacy, fairness, and response to discrimination and deprivation. Refl ections on the failure to reach a legally binding agreement on climate change at the UN Summit in Copenhagen, in December, 2009, suggest the diffi culty of establishing truly global agreement regarding obligations beyond boundaries. Further, the focus of Copenhagen was on a subject, climate change, for which global inter-relationship of states was much more evident than can be argued for other aspects of human, social, and environmental development relating to health, livelihoods, learning, energy, etc. Yet nowadays all these elements have global dimensions that link national and local interests-a fact made particularly clear from the recent food security and fi nancial crises. In view of the enormous diffi culties of establishing an institutional architecture at the summit for any ambitious vision of global obligation with regard to climate change and its eff ects, what is the best that can be hoped for the notion of global obligation with regard to the MDGs?We argue for the importance of a position on global obligation that values human rights with respect to human, social, and environmental development. Thus our concerns with wellbeing are not just limited to the obligations we have to citizens of our own country, but to individuals everywhere. 116 However, we would also argue that the expression of these values does not dictate a particular set of responses. Indeed, the form of the response will diff er in diff erent locales, given particular histories, and present form of social and political relationships. In looking forward to a future for development goal setting, we argue for maintaining and deepening the sense of global obligation that they represent. One way to achieve this would be to deepen levels of local and regional ownership of the process. In this way the powerplay and international politicking that was evident at Copenhagen might, to some extent, be reduced.The challenge for taking forward the MDG vision entails not only developing and deepening the normative language of shared obligation on selected areas, but putting in place institutional frames and political processes that can help to build and support this process. Can UN reform address this institutional challenge for global obligation? In January, 2008, Ban Ki-moon outlined leadership on achieving the MDGs as an objective of UN reform. The Secretary-General stressed the importance of improving capacity, developing synergies, and building partnerships, 117 but the politics of achieving these aims has been very complex. The eff ects of the fi nancial crisis and fi scal austerity on the aid budgets that might fi nance this development and on the local resources that might sustain it remain unclear. A further diffi culty is that the UN\\'s hopeful aspirations for human development coexist in a globalised political economy that is marked by substantial inequality and exploitation.Finally, ensuring that the framework is seen as a global framework, rather than just one aff ecting developing countries, is important in setting a future development agenda. It means that all countries, rich and poor, have obligations and subscribe to targets for which they are accountable.\\n\\nThe future of health development goals\\n\\nIn this fi nal section we show the application of our proposed principles to one particular element of wellbeing. We have selected health, since it has been a major feature of the MDGs, being the focus of MDGs 4, 5, and 6, and an element of MDGs 1, 7, and 8. We consider how each of the principles presented in the last section might apply to the development of future health goals. In many cases, what we propose can apply equally to other elements of wellbeing-eg, energy, learning; hence this approach is very much a procedural template for all development goals.A holistic approach to health development Application of our principle of holism to health development would, fi rst, mean a greater focus on the broad health gains that can be realised through an integrated health systems approach, with a better balance between horizontal and vertical features of health action. Key areas of inequity would need particular attention, including those addressed by specifi c, present MDGs. But a more holistic approach is best built on a framework of reasonable health expectations over a lifetime, which would address present gaps and accommodate diff erences in health challenges in diff erent countries.Such a life course approach could identify the following stages and expectations: • Pregnancy: access to antenatal care; adequate maternal nutrition; protection from exposure to dangerous infections and toxins. • Infancy: a reasonable probability of survival coupled with access to a loving parental relationship; protection from death or disability attributable to malnutrition, vaccine-preventable and other infections, trauma, or other causes. • Childhood: quality primary school education; safe space for play at home and school; protection from abuse in the home environment; cognitive and social development; adequate nutrition and protection from both hunger and obesity. • Adolescence: reproductive and sexual health; increasing autonomy; self-respect; access to social security for those with learning diffi culties; fulfi lling potential. • Adulthood: access to care, diagnosis, and treatment for major causes of death and disability (childbirth, noncommunicable diseases, mental health, major infectious diseases); employment opportunities and a social welfare net. • Elderly: social inclusion; dignity in dying; dementia and disability services. These stages would be provided within the framework of a health system encompassing the building blocks of service delivery; health workforce; information; medical products, vaccines, and technologies; fi nancing; and leadership and governance (stewardship). 118 A functioning health system is the sum total of all the organisations, institutions, and resources whose primary purpose is to improve health. It should provide responsive and fi nancially fair preventive and treatment services, and population-based public health activities including community mobilisation in pursuit of health improvement. A new health development agenda would look for parallel requirements between various conditions, and seek to capitalise on synergies. For example, antenatal care services have high coverage in many settings, and are now being used to deliver malaria and HIV services. General support of cross-cutting issues such as fi nancing, governance, accountability, and some elements of human resources and information systems can also include an emphasis on accountability for progress towards spec ifi c conditions.A desirable feature of such a holistic approach with its emphasis on the life course and on the health system is its contribution to synergy with other elements of wellbeing. For example, there is implicit here a greater focus on prevention of poor health, which links with learning in childhood and adolescence in particular, and with the specifi c needs of women. Not only human, but also social and environmental dimensions of wellbeing, would be needed to address health over a life course-eg, the social capacity to provide for elderly people and the environmental capacity to ensure provision of healthy diets and reduced pollution, restricting chronic disease in adulthood.From an operational point of view, holistic health targets and interventions would need to be linked with complementary targets and interventions for other elements of wellbeing, so that these synergies were realised. For example, in the case of learning targets which relate to health, that health and learning programme interventions reach the same groups of people is important. However, educators and health workers do not have to be working alongside each other. Rather, those who plan education and health interventions should work together on how to target diff erent groups, balancing the value of coordinated action with the possibility that the groups most in need of health and education interventions might not be the same.Some interventions need planning at the household, village or local community, region, or country level, and there may for some services be economies of scale in integrated (rather than simply coordinated) service delivery. Planning for learning and health, for example, will generally need collaborative planning involving more than one line authority but a clear division of labour for subsequent implementation. Ongoing monitoring and assessment of progress, however, would often benefi t from some degree of joint action by representatives of more than one group, particularly for identifi cation of the highest risk groups. Evaluation of inequities in this area and monitoring the eff ect of interventions on these inequities should be a joint activity.The Countdown to 2015 initiative, a suprainstitutional collaborative eff ort of concerned individuals and partner organisations, provides a partial model for how linkages can be built. Together with the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health, it attempts to bring together the diverse technical health communities for the constituencies of maternal, newborn, and child health, using a continuum-of-care paradigm. Moreover, within MDGs 4 and 5, it tracks coverage levels for health interventions that are proven to reduce maternal, newborn, and child mortality. A range of indicators are assessed, from mortality eff ects, outcomes such as immunisation coverage, and health inputs (such as emergency obstetric care facilities per population), to policies such as legislation around maternity leave. Equity and health-system indicators are specifi cally addressed.\\n\\nEquity and health\\n\\nWe have identifi ed equity as relating to both intergenerational and intragenerational processes. Applied to health, intergenerational equity involves the recognition, for example, that maternal health contributes to child health, and child health and development to health later in life, including reproductive health. A socalled life course approach described above is one way, therefore, of embedding intergenerational equity in health development, since it places emphasis on actions in one generation that promote the health of subsequent generations. Environmental actions that protect healthrelated ecosystem services-eg, the provision of clean water and air-are particularly important for intergenerational equity because environmental change is so slow and diffi cult to reverse.With respect to intragenerational equity in health development, our aim is to ensure that eff orts to promote human development do not continue to leave behind the most vulnerable and marginalised individuals or communities. Therefore we advocate the use of our growing understanding of equity to focus on the most disadvantaged sections-the equivalent of a pro-poor approach. Wealth quintiles have found useful application to the MDGs, particularly with respect to poverty and health targets. 73, 74 Analyses based on this approach have been instrumental in drawing attention to the extent to which recent progress in many areas has been at the expense of growing inequity. However, when applied nationally, results based on wealth quintiles do not always seem to make sense. Sometimes this situation arises because the key drivers of inequity are factors other than economic poverty, so economic poverty might understate the disparities that exist. At other times they point to fundamental problems with the data itself, such as systematic under-reporting. In some African countries, reported levels of neonatal and infant mortality are substantially lower in the poorest quintiles than some of the wealthier ones. 119 This eff ect is almost certainly due to systematic under-reporting in the poorest and most marginalised groups, who are likely to be suspicious of young data collectors coming from the cities. Adjustment for these eff ects would produce a more accurate, but less welcome estimate of child mortality for the aff ected countries.As we have discussed previously in this report, inequity has many dimensions. Economic inequity (or poverty in its narrowest defi nition) is the most important dimension in many settings, yet it is not always captured by analyses based on wealth. From the perspective of uptake of health services, what really matters is access to cash when it is needed to take care of an unexpected illness in the family. Furthermore, the cash must be accessible for the person taking care of the sick individual-eg, a mother taking care of her child, or a woman needing ongoing treatment for a chronic disease. Too often women do not have access to cash. Thus, gender becomes an important determinant of inequity. Systematic disempowerment of women is a pervasive barrier to development in all areas, most particularly health and education. In some settings, particular ethnic groups are also disadvantaged, and unless this inequity is highlighted and understood, such groups cannot be eff ectively targeted.In some countries, geographical barriers become an important determinant of access to health and education services. Such barriers could be mountains (eg, in Ethiopia, Papua New Guinea), desert (eg, in Niger), or the sea (eg, in many small island communities in the Pacifi c). In large countries such as the Philippines, inequity can be determined diff erently in diff erent regions.To address inequity in health development, therefore, we need to improve understanding of inequities within and between communities, both nationally and subnationally. In some settings socioeconomic factors will be the main determinants of inequity, in terms of education, health, and other areas. In other settings, geographic factors, ethnic origin, or gender can be important determinants of inequity. Simple methods are needed to enable countries to decide which factors are most important for them, and to monitor inequities in health, education, and other areas by monitoring one or more of the key determinants, as interventions are being implemented. Monitoring of inequities in both opportunities and outcomes will enable countries to understand whether existing or future programmes are reducing or indeed increasing inequity. For example, in some countries, a detailed analysis of factors associated with child mortality would likely show that, although socioeconomic factors have a role, with low risk recorded in the wealthiest quintile, a more important determinant of mortality risk is living in an area with no eff ective health services. On the basis of such an analysis, the government might then elect to monitor intervention coverage and mortality in a representative sample of such areas to ensure that as mortality is reduced nationally, the equity gap between the highest risk and lowest risk groups is also narrowed. Structured yearly surveys might be needed to monitor progress.Some countries have consistently adopted a pro-equity approach. For example, Peru targeted the implementation of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI), 120 the WHO/UNICEF strategy to manage sick children, to the highest risk groups 86 -an approach that they have taken with other interventions such as the introduction of a vaccine for Haemophilus infl uenzae type b. Other countries have by contrast chosen to implement IMCI in areas already served by well functioning health systems.A fi nal and challenging feature of equity in health development is the issue of how to distribute scarce resources among a population-eg, for vaccination. Generally, the small number of children living in a very remote area will have high risk of vaccine-preventable disease, particularly diseases for which eff ective health care would greatly reduce the risk of mortality, specifi cally diarrhoeal disease and pneumonia. These issues are even starker when the health services in question are not preventive services that can be delivered through mobile services, but rather treatments that need to be accessed at unspecifi ed times. Here the costs of reaching remote areas with fi xed services can be particularly high, as refl ected in the wide quintile gaps seen for delivery care compared with immunisation, for example. 121 Short of 100% coverage, there are no absolutes. A country might be faced with a real choice of either spending the available funds trying to get 100% coverage, or accepting that 80% is quite good, and electing to use the available funds to introduce a new vaccine, such as that for rotavirus. The utilitarian approach would argue that the net benefi ts are greater if the new vaccine is introduced into the 80% of people already covered, whereas the rights-based approach would argue that the 20% of children have a right to routine vaccines and should be the fi rst priority. At higher levels of coverage this dilemma might become even more diffi cult as the cost of immunising a small number of unimmunised children might become very high, if, for example, a\\n\\nPanel 6: Development of health goals in Thailand beyond the MDGs\\n\\nThailand has achieved almost all the MDG targets well before the 2015 commitment, and introduced a concept of MDG Plus-a set of country-specifi c targets going beyond the international MDG targets. All MDG Plus targets were taken from the agreed targets in the national plans and strategies of line ministries in consultation with all relevant partners. MDG Plus is equity sensitive by going beyond national average goals, making the global MDGs a fl oor instead of a ceiling. By adopting goals and targets that are customised to local needs and priorities, MDG Plus has become a central theme in Thailand\\'s multisectoral human development movements. 122 In 2002, the MDG poverty target of halving, between 1990 and 2015, the percentage of people living in poverty was reached. 123 MDG Plus aimed to bring down poverty incidence further to less than 4% by 2009, and the continuing trend of poverty reduction suggests this target was achievable despite the unforeseen global economic crisis of 2008-09. Additionally, the percentage of people living below the food poverty line and the prevalence of the underweight in children younger than 5 years have exceeded the 2015 targets since the early 2000s. MDG Plus gave special attention to children in northern highland provinces, where there are higher rates of malnutrition, and shifted focus from protein and energy defi ciency, which were not problems, to micronutrient defi ciency and in particular iodine, iron, and vitamin A in school children.There are several lessons on how Thailand achieved the health-related MDGs and moved beyond them. The commitment of successive governments since the 1970s in investing in the health of the population, and consistent favourable economic growth, were the main determinants of the development of health-system infrastructure. 124 Huge investment in the district health system, and eff orts to protect poor and underprivileged people from catastrophic health-care costs through targeting approaches from 1975, replaced by a policy of universal coverage in 2002, contributed substantially to health achievement in both level and distribution. 125, 126 Functioning primary health care was an outcome of the national policy of extending rural health services to all subdistricts and districts, and of the policy from the 1970s of compulsory rural health services for all medical and nursing graduates. District health systems serve as a close-to-client service hub that is accessible to the vast majority of rural poor people, as refl ected in various indicators: 98% coverage of antenatal care that facilitated rapid nationwide scaling up of the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV programme within a year in 2001, 73% prevalence of modern contraceptive use, and 98% immunisation coverage of DTP3 (third dose of diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and pertussis vaccine). 127 Universal access results in very small rich-poor and urban-rural gaps of use of maternal and child health services, 128 which is a key contributor to MDG 4 and MDG 5. In 2009, more than 150 000 people living with HIV were enrolled in the universal antiretroviral programme provided by district health providers.Empirical evidence shows the equitable outcomes of the universal coverage scheme launched in 2002. For example, the tax-fi nanced universal coverage scheme is progressive, with rich people contributing a greater share of their income than poor people. The comprehensive benefi t package, free at the point of service, has produced a very low incidence of catastrophic health expenditure and impoverishment. 129 Recent inclusion of renal dialysis in the package has fostered poverty reduction. 130 Without the extensive district health system, the universal coverage policy would be mere rhetoric, in which citizen rights were ensured only on paper and poor people would be unable to access and use services.In conclusion, Thailand benefi ted from rapid economic growth and government commitment to human development to achieve the MDGs early. Eff orts are in place to ensure that development is achieved universally through locally defi ned MDG Plus goals and targets. Lessons from Thailand show that the MDGs were achieved through sustainable health-system development. Wide geographical coverage of functioning primary health care at district and subdistrict levels, and the adoption of the universality principle, are major contributors to the achievement of the health-related MDs in Thailand.helicopter is needed to reach some small isolated settlements. This dilemma is familiar to health offi cials in developing countries. Although there might be no right or wrong answers, a real analysis of the costs and benefi ts of various approaches would empower countries to make more reasoned decisions.\\n\\nOwnership and health\\n\\nThe ownership processes that we suggested above, involving integration of local, national, and regional priorities to generate national, regional, and global targets, would apply well to health and to other elements of wellbeing. On the basis of agreed health objectives in the life course, decisions could be made nationally about how these would be prioritised, on the basis of national needs and opportunities, through a process involving, ideally, local government and civil society.Goal design and setting would benefi t in some cases from support to national programmes to analyse and understand the determinants of poor health outcomes, providing such programmes with the instruments needed for truly evidence-based decision making to set priorities in health. Thus, in the area of child survival, decisions would then be less easily dominated by pressure from special interest groups, or the particular preferences of funding agencies. When a reasoned analysis based on real and valid data has indicated the most suitable approach for a country to take, donors and outside pressure groups will need to take notice. The same support would help nations to develop their own, most eff ective and appropriate indicators and methods to monitor progress. Useful models for such national ownership and development of health goals can be found in the experiences of governments that have made use of, and improved on, existing MDGs. Panel 6 shows an example of such a model in Thailand.\\n\\nGlobal obligation and health\\n\\nExercising global obligation in health development would need a commitment by wealthy countries to supporting poorer countries to improve health-service provision and thereby improve global equity of access to improved health outcomes. Donor funding would be an element, and is an important feature of the present MDGs. We suggest that more attention needs to be focused on the interactions between wealthy and poor countries that constrain poor countries from improving their own health outcomes. These interactions include addressing patterns of training and employment of health workers internationally that leaves poorer countries paying for training of health workers who then settle in wealthier countries. They also include strengthening of science and innovation systems in poorer countries so that they might play a more equitable part in developing and benefi ting from new health services and technologies. This support for developing countries might mean a greater local role in public-private partnerships for medicines development, particularly in the use of local natural resources and indigenous knowledge for development of new treatments. Or it could mean strengthening disease surveillance systems and their ownership by poorer countries to reduce their disproportionate burden of infectious diseases while improving global health security to prevent future disease pandemics.Most interventions such as these would be of mutual benefi t to all countries, improving access by all to health care and medicines. Their achievement could involve targeting based less on thresholds for specifi c outcomes in poorer countries and more on demonstrable adoption and successful implementation of policies that support equitable outcomes for all countries. In this context, work done by the World Bank on environmental policy targets for MDG 7 might be a useful model. 44 \\n\\nSustainability and health\\n\\nTo achieve the holistic expectations considered above throughout the life course needs several interlinked systems to function eff ectively. It also needs suffi cient reliable and continual funding. Over the past 17 years, there have been various attempts to calculate the costs of scaled up health care, including the Essential Health Care Package approach introduced in the World Bank\\'s World Development Report 1993, the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health 131 that addressed the health development fi nance needs for countries below a gross national product of $1200 per head, and the 2009 High Level Taskforce on Innovative International Financing for Health Systems that was concerned with all low-income countries. The Commission on Macroeconomics and\\n\\nReuters\\n\\nThe printed journal includes an image merely for illustrationHealth estimated a 2002 cost of $38 per head for a scaled up set of essential interventions for low-income countries in 2015, and calculated that $4 per head on average would need to come from external funding. The Taskforce undertook a much more comprehensive costing, and estimated a 2005 cost of $54 per head for scaled up services in 2015, with around $9 to come from external fi nancing on the assumption that donor countries lived up to their commitments to development assistance. 33, 34, 132 Both sets of analyses made assumptions on desirable levels of domestic support to health that greatly exceed present levels of government health expenditure. In view of present rates of economic growth and continuing population expansion, sustained development assistance for health and considerable additional domestic fi nance are needed if we are to move towards the collective national and international aspirations for health even over the next decades. Most health expenditure in low-income countries still comes from private, mostly out-of-pocket payments (mean of $13 per head in 2006), with domestic government budgets contributing an average of $12, and development assistance making a smaller but important contribution of $6. 33 The goal of the above health intervention and system strengthening initiatives is to plan, design, and build an effi cient, equitable, and responsive health system without the distorting eff ects and special pleading of particular interest groups. Sector-wide approaches to fi nancing encourage all interested partners, both domestic governmental and external investors, to pool their resources so that one health plan can be implemented, monitored, and reported upon. The challenge that has arisen in some countries is that when domestic budgets are tightened, and external donors do not meet their expected contributions, there are not enough resources for all. In this situation the fi xed recurrent costs, particularly salaries, still have to be met, and as a result funds for services and commodities are unavailable, leading to shortages and stock-outs even for those activities that are seen as key priorities within the plan. Thus, proponents of specifi c interventions-such as vaccination for children, or completion of tuberculosis treatment to prevent emergence of costly drug resistance-have good grounds to advocate for protected funding for a few key programmes. And so we rapidly fall back into the same discussion of disease-specifi c programmes in tension with broader system-wide strengthening of the building blocks of the health system.To escape this dichotomy, we need to move the debate beyond the fi nancial sustainability of individual countries\\' health budgets. Sustainability has to be linked to global obligation and solidarity that allows rational planning with the assumption that funding will be predictable, reliable, and increasing every year. The declarations made by governments of both rich and poor countries have to be upheld. Sub-Saharan African countries have committed to increase expenditure on health to 15% of general government expenditure, and almost all rich countries have committed to raising their development assistance to 0·7% of their gross national income as well as giving commitments to specifi c goals such as universal access to treatment for HIV, which remains a target for MDG 6 for this year. 33 Unless governments deliver on these commitments, aspirations for the holistic interpretation that we put on health and development will remain mere dreams.Sustainability for the health sector can also be considered in terms that go beyond fi nancial security, to guide investment towards areas that lead to stronger human, physical, and social capital and that build systems more likely to resist or recover from the shocks that aff ect their productivity. 108 For example, large amounts of external investment fl ow into expensive technical assistance, whereas a more sustainable approach might see that investment channelled into building local and regional expertise that could eventually replace the external support.The Global Fund now supports a large proportion of the millions of people living in the poorest countries who are taking antiretroviral therapy, and there is increasing concern about maintaining donor commitments to universal access in view of the economic uncertainties. Countries are encouraged to submit proposals that show the potential for sustainability. This criterion is expanded to encompass, among other criteria, proposals that show high-level, sustained political involvement and commitment, strengthening the various elements of national health systems, and strengthening of civil society and community systems in its diff erent components (eg, management capacity, service delivery, and infra structure), with an emphasis on key aff ected populations.The so-called killer diseases of MDG 6 are all infectious diseases, which leads to one further aspect of sustainability and health-namely, the possibility of eradication of infectious pathogens. A strong case can be made for disproportionate and unsustainable investment if there is a realistic chance that in the longer term such investment will lead to eradication of a disease and consequent gains in wellbeing (and reductions in ongoing costs). The eradication of smallpox from the world and the recent success in elimination of severe acute respiratory syndrome from human populations are notable triumphs led by WHO. However, expensive campaigns against poliomyelitis that disrupt community health services have seen recent set-backs, and the shift from control to elimination of malaria has been argued in Africa to be \"at best irrelevant and at worst counterproductive\". 133 For HIV there are ambitious mathematical models suggesting that major investment in testing and early treatment could lead to overall savings in the future by reducing transmission. 134 Thus sustainability for infectious diseases might have a diff erent tenor to sustainability for health in general, for which we need to plan for ongoing and expanding costs that can be met only by a concerted and planned eff ort to draw on both domestic and external fi nance, including from innovative sources. 34 This is especially the case as the non communicable disease burden rises as the epidemiological transition proceeds.\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nIn application of our development principles to health elements of wellbeing, we would envisage future health development goals that are focused on sustainable health systems, built around delivering health objectives across the life course. This objective would involve close linkage with learning, economic, social, and environmental elements necessary to achieving these objectives, which themselves could involve other goal development processes based on elements of improved wellbeing. From a procedural perspective, these health objectives would be agreed by international consensus, and how they were then developed into goals would be a process led at the national level, building through dialogue to a set of regional and global goals. We suggest that such goals avoid threshold-based targets and indicators that might increase inequity and instead aim to generate wellbeing for all, while taking a proactive, pro-poor approach. Global cooperation would emphasise supporting countries to achieve goals in more diverse ways than simply donor funding. Sustainability would be incorporated through a high degree of national ownership and ongoing investment in human, social, and physical capital.\\n\\nContributors\\n\\nMembers of the Lancet-LIDC Commission contributed to the development of the structure of the report, writing and commenting on drafts.

The eight goals address targets to increase incomes; reduce hunger; achieve universal primary education; eliminate gender inequality; reduce maternal and child mortality; reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; reverse the loss of natural resources and biodiversity; improve access to water, sanitation, and good housing; and establish eff ective global partnerships. Progress in some goals has been impressive; however, global targets will not be met in some regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. As we approach the 2015 target date, there is considerable interest in assessment of the present goals and in consideration of the future of development goals after 2015.This Commission has brought together sectoral experts on diff erent MDGs from the London International Development Centre to identify cross-cutting challenges that have emerged from MDG implementation so far. This interdisciplinary approach diff ers from previous MDG studies that have either examined individual goals or made broad sociopolitical assessments of the MDGs as a development mechanism. We used our analysis of crosscutting challenges as the basis to identify a set of principles for future goal development, after 2015. We emphasise that this report is not an assessment of the MDGs; we focus deliberately on challenges with the implementation of the MDGs so as to inform future goal setting.The MDGs are an assembly of sector-specifi c and often quite narrowly focused targets that have their various origins in development ideas and campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s. They were not derived from an inclusive analysis and prioritisation of development needs, and this is refl ected in the absence from them of a range of key development issues. The variable progress recorded with goals and targets partly indicates a tendency over time to focus on a subset of targets that have proven easier to implement and monitor, or which have stronger ownership by international or national institutions, or both. Complexity and lack of ownership have been particular problems for new targets added later in the MDG process. We provide short analyses of each MDG for those seeking more depth and to set out the evidence for a cross-MDG analysis (webappendix).Clearly the MDGs have had notable success in encouraging global political consensus, providing a focus\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) emerged from the United Nations (UN) Millennium Declaration in 2000, and are arguably the most politically important pact ever made for international development. 1 They identify specifi c development priorities across a very broad range, including poverty, education, gender, health, environment, and international partnerships. These goals have substantially shaped development dialogue and investment; some development agencies judge all their activities on the contribution to achievement of the MDGs. 2 Overall, progress towards the MDGs has been described as \"patchy\" 3 and \"uneven\". 4 The broad conclusion is that few goals are entirely on track globally, and those that are show substantial variation, with least progress in Africa and often south Asia. Whereas MDG 1 (eradication of extreme poverty and hunger) is on course to be achieved and \"remarkable improvements\" have been made regarding aspects of MDG 6 (combating of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases), insuffi cient progress has been made towards achievement of MDG 2 (provision of universal primary education), MDG 4 (reduction of child mortality), and MDG 5 (reduction of maternal mortality). 4, 5 Steps towards MDG 3 (promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women) have been labelled \"sluggish\"; \"alarmingly high\" rates of deforestation are hampering MDG 7 (ensuring of environmental sustainability); and Africa is \"short-changed\" by the aid fl ows included under MDG 8 (development of a global partnership for development). 4 Moreover, the global economic crisis has accentuated the urgency of the discussion, and progress is being jeopardised because of new fi nancial constraints. 6 As we approach the two-thirds mark for the achievement of these goals in 2015, attention is focused on acceleration of progress, and on whether these goals are the right model for international development after 2015. So far, analysis of the MDGs as models for international development has taken two forms. The fi rst involves sector-specifi c assessment of progress towards individual MDGs, largely by sectoral experts. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The second involves broader analysis of the MDGs as instruments of development, largely by international development specialists. 3, 12, 13 We believe that an understanding of the MDGs and future improvements in goal setting benefi ts from consideration of all goals together, because they are so interconnected and because their individual implementation has identifi ed many common issues. The purpose of this report is to identify challenges that have emerged in delivery of the MDGs that are common to diff erent goals and to suggest how future goal setting can be improved to avoid these diffi culties. We do not undertake to present a verdict on the MDGs, or a balanced assessment weighing advantages and disadvantages. We focus deliberately on problems with the MDGs to identify See Online for webappendix better future approaches. We will not propose specifi c changes in MDGs after 2015, but will suggest a set of principles that might guide future goal development. This Commission is intended for a broad readership interested in all MDGs and for a more health-focused readership, who we hope will gain an improved understanding of the important relations between health and other MDG targets.We begin part 1 of our report with a brief introduction to the MDGs, which is accompanied by a webappendix presenting analyses of the development and implementation of each MDG. In part 2, we present a cross-cutting comparison and analysis of MDGs 1-7. We restrict our analysis to these seven MDGs because they share a focus, across very diff erent sectors, on action in and by developing countries, whereas MDG 8 is focused more on actions by wealthy countries. We derive from this analysis the common challenges facing the MDGs. In part 3, we use these challenges to develop and illustrate fi ve principles for future development goal setting, with health as a theme.\\n\\nThis Commission was undertaken at the request of\\n\\nThe Lancet by the London International Development Centre (LIDC)-a consortium of six University of London colleges (Birkbeck, Institute of Education, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, School of Oriental and African Studies, Royal Veterinary College, and the School of Pharmacy). LIDC is dedicated to novel, intersectoral, and interdisciplinary approaches to international development. The Commission was codesigned with The Lancet, coordinated by LIDC, and prepared by experts in three LIDC member institutions: the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Institute of Education, and School of Oriental and African Studies, and their research partners in South Africa, Zambia, Malawi, India, and Thailand. This team brought specifi c, individual expertise with MDGs 1-7, from diff erent development perspectives and backgrounds. To build a team approach, each expert was asked with her or his partners to write a critique of their MDG and to contribute ideas arising from this analysis towards the design of future development goals. All participants read these papers as preparation for a 2-day facilitated workshop that identifi ed issues and challenges that cut across the MDGs and built a consensus about future development goal setting. During four subsequent, smaller workshops, this consensus was developed into a fi nal document. Although overseas partners could participate only in the fi rst main workshop, all contributed towards subsequent development and have made contributions to the fi nal version, including specifi c case studies. Analyses of individual MDGs are provided (webappendix) for readers interested in more detail. They provide the evidence base for the crosscutting analysis.\\n\\nBackground to the MDGs\\n\\nThe MDGs comprise a set of eight goals and associated targets and indicators. They represent the latest eff ort in a long process of development goal setting which had antecedents in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Development Decade of the 1960s, and the many UN summits of the second half of the 20th century that set specifi c goals to reduce hunger, improve health, eradicate diseases, and school children. 14 The immediate antecedent of the MDGs was the Millennium Declaration, presented in 2000 at the UN Millennium Summit. 15 The Millennium Declaration presented six values that were considered to be fundamental to international relations in the 21st century: freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for nature, and shared responsibility. Seven key objectives were identifi ed to translate these shared values into actions: peace, security, and disarmament; development and poverty eradication; protection of our common environment; human rights, democracy, and good governance; protection of vulnerable people; meeting of the special needs of Africa; and strengthening of the UN. The second objective, development and poverty eradication, was translated into eleven resolutions, presented as development targets. Many of these targets had legacies that predated the Millennium Declaration and had arisen from sector-specifi c UN-sponsored and other world conferences and summits during the previous decades. Most had appeared as international development targets in the report of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Shaping the 21st century: the contribution of development cooperation. 16 The OECD\\'s international development targets were particularly infl uential in the determination of the relevant text of the Millennium Declaration. With the addition of a few more targets, particularly for environmental sustainability, these became the MDGs. In turn these targets were linked post hoc with indicators, for the purposes of measurement, and with goals, for the purpose of conceptual simplicity. By 2001 the MDG framework comprised eight goals, 18 targets, and 48 indicators. 17 A few more targets and indicators were added later, creating the set presented in panel 1.To understand the MDGs, the political context in which they arose has to be appreciated. Several recent analyses have provided a useful insight into how the MDGs represent an integration of diff erent international development strategies and initiatives emerging over recent decades. Hulme, 19 for instance, suggests that the MDGs developed through an interaction between, on the one hand, a US-led, neo-liberal ideology (one that promotes economic growth based on free trade and markets) linked to results-based management and, on the other hand, a development approach of some other wealthy countries, multilaterals, and non-governmental organisation (NGOs) that focused on multidimensional For more on the London International Development Centre see http://www.lidc. org.uk human development-eg, health, education, and gender equity, treating these as both development goals and development means. The emerging goals are biased towards a human development approach-\"fi ve and a half of the eight MDGs are about enhancing human capabilities\" 19 -and there is a strong emphasis on basic needs. However, they also incorporate neo-liberal thinking about economic growth into their important poverty goal (MDG 1), and their overall results-based framework focused greatly on international development partnerships. Manning 3 observes how the early neo-liberal leanings of the goals were tempered by recognition of the need for buy-in by developing countries and by NGOs, leading to the inclusion of goals more focused on human welfare and development, such as health and education.In addition to their integration of diff erent development challenges and approaches, the MDGs also provided a novel, target-oriented framework for the international development community. Gore 13 suggests that in tempering earlier neo-liberal approaches to development with human development objectives, the MDGs represent a switch from a \"procedural conception of international society\" to a \"purposive conception\". The former involves \"an association of States joined together through their common respect for a set of rules, norms and standard practices which govern the relationships between them\" whereas the latter involves \"an association of States joined together in a cooperative venture to promote common ends\". 13 With this target focus came an important shift from maximalist views of development (in which development involves poorer countries achieving aspirations of equality with richer countries) to minimalist standards (of proportions of people crossing poverty thresholds or accessing particular services or avoiding mortality or morbidity); and from societal and national change to changes for individuals within nation states. The emphasis on specifi c and minimalist targets, and the way in which it narrowed the development agenda and placed particular responsibilities on developing country governments, has generated many of the challenges facing implementation of the MDGs.Our study is based on the comparison of experiences across the diff erent MDGs. To facilitate this comparison, we provide analyses of each MDG: how it was developed, how it has been implemented, and what this information tells us about its success so far. This analysis is provided in the webappendix, which we recommend readers consult for a deeper understanding of MDG performance. We use the analyses of MDGs 1-7 as the evidence base for our analysis in part 2 of this Commission.These MDG analyses show that the MDGs and their targets all have their origins in development initiatives that predate the Millennium Declaration. For the most part, the MDGs constitute an assembly of often very narrowly focused and sector-specifi c development ideas and campaigns from the 1980s and 1990s. Their targets are often so narrow as to neglect important development issues in the same sector-eg, tertiary education, reproductive health, and a range of gender issues. At their conception, therefore, the MDGs were not a plan derived bottom-up from a broad, intersectoral conceptualisation of development and prioritisation of development needs, although superfi cially they might seem to have been. These summaries also show that progress has varied between goals and between targets. Although some goals were set up with a range of targets and indicators, subsequent attention and monitoring for any goal has usually focused on a subset of these targets and indicators, sometimes only one. This narrowing process could be an indication of diff erences in ease of target implementation and monitoring, and in the level of ownership by international and other institutions, with little ownership or overlap in ownership reducing progress. Generally, eff orts to improve MDGs by adding new targets at a later date have not been very successful, owing to the complexity of these targets and their indicators or to limited ownership, or both.\\n\\nPositive contributions of the MDGs\\n\\nIn this section, we use our studies of individual MDGs as the evidence base from which we build a cross-cutting analysis. When appropriate, we relate our conclusions to other reviews of the MDGs that have used a range of approaches. 2, 3, 12, 13, 15, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] The performance of individual MDGs so far suggests that they have made four important positive contributions: encouraging global political consensus, providing a focus for advocacy, improving the targeting and fl ow of aid, and improving the monitoring of development projects.Endorsed by 189 governments, the MDGs represent an unprecedented consensus on international development. In this context, they have been more successful than have some of the UN\\'s earlier development initiatives, such as the Development Decades of the 1960-90s or the resolutions about Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States. 3 In a 2005 survey of 118 countries, 86% had reportedly acted in response to the MDGs. 25 The MDGs are claimed to be \"the fi rst global development vision that combines a global political endorsement with a clear focus on, and means to engage directly with, the world\\'s poor people\". 1 The survey of individual MDGs (webappendix) shows how the MDGs have helped advocacy of particular development agendas. For popular agendas, such as those to reduce poverty (MDG 1) and infectious diseases (MDG 6), MDGs provided additional leverage, whereas for relatively neglected agendas such as child survival (MDG 4) and gender (MDG 3), their eff ect was to reinvigorate these campaigns. In the case of gender, for example, the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995 had led to the establishment of gender (Continued from previous page)• Indicator 6.3: proportion of population aged 15-24 years with comprehensive correct knowledge of HIV/AIDS • Indicator 6.4: ratio of school attendance of orphans to school attendance of non-orphans aged 10-14 years • Target 6B: achieve, by 2010, universal access to treatment for HIV/AIDS for all those who need it • Indicator 6.5: proportion of population with advanced HIV infection with access to antiretroviral drugs • Target 6C: have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the incidence of malaria and other major diseases • Indicator 6.6: incidence and death rates associated with malaria • Indicator 6.7: proportion of children younger than 5 years sleeping under insecticide-treated bednets • Indicator 6.8: proportion of children younger than 5 years with fever who are treated with appropriate antimalarial drugs • Indicator 6.9: incidence, prevalence, and death rates associated with tuberculosis • Indicator 6.10: proportion of tuberculosis cases detected and cured under directly observed treatment short course mechanisms and approaches to mainstreaming of gender issues within several ministries. Their achievements were fragile, 26, 27 until the MDGs stimulated donors to include gender equity in aid packages. [28] [29] [30] The MDGs are generally thought to have improved the targeting and fl ow of aid and other investments, supported by the way in which donors have linked the MDGs to their strategies for aid provision 6 and by evidence of an increase in resource mobilisation. 21 According to OECD fi gures, between 2000, when the Millennium Declaration was adopted, and 2006, total development assistance for health has more than doubled from US$6·8 billion to $16·7 billion, most of it focused on infectious diseases (MDG 6). 31 Large increases in donors\\' fi nancial commitments to education, which can fairly transparently be linked to MDG 2, were recorded after 2000.However, the cases of health and education also show how diffi cult it is to establish a cause and eff ect relationship between the MDGs and an increase in aid. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw the conceptualisation and creation of several independent initiatives in health and education, including the International Finance Facility for Immunisation; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; Business Alliance Against Chronic Hunger; and the initiatives following the Education for All conferences in Jomtien (1990) and Dakar (2000) , whose objectives overlapped with those adopted subsequently in MDG 6 and MDG 2. The contribution of the MDGs, in these cases, might best be viewed as reinforcing, rather than driving, the targeting and mobilisation of resources.Finally, the MDGs have stimulated an improvement in monitoring development programmes through data collection and analysis: \"Once the MDGs gained currency, a cascade of statistical and analytical work got underway\". 23 Although we have noted that across the MDGs there are profound questions about the quality of the data obtained from such monitoring, few would disagree that it has been benefi cial to evaluation, and probably to investment.\\n\\nChallenges posed by the MDGs\\n\\nSet against these positive contributions are several shortcomings that emerge consistently across our analysis of individual MDGs. Characteristically, most of these weaknesses present themselves as the fl ip side of the MDGs\\' more positive elements. Thus, the parsimony of the MDGs, which has probably facilitated their acceptance and use, makes them at the same time limited in scope, whereas their quantitative targets and precise indicators, for all their value in providing measurable outcomes, often fail to capture some crucial elements of goal achievement. We have to accept that all goal setting involves such trade-off s.However, the value of focusing on shortcomings of the MDGs lies in our potential to improve them, or replace them with something better. Ineff ective MDGs pose two risks: they might not achieve their intended eff ect, and they could lead to negative eff ects by ignoring or impeding more eff ective development and poverty reduction. Our analysis identifi es challenges with the MDGs in four areas: conceptualisation, execution, ownership, and equity. Other studies have also identifi ed cross-cutting issues, 12,22 which we will discuss as appropriate.\\n\\nConceptualisation and execution\\n\\nWe consider fi rst how well the MDGs have been developed at diff erent levels-goal, target, and indicator-which has obvious consequences for how well they have been executed at each level. For instance, an indicator for which accurate data cannot be obtained is poorly conceived and prevents execution of the target. In table 1 we show some diffi culties relating to conceptualisation and execution, drawn from our individual analyses of the MDGs presented in the webappendix. This list is illustrative and not meant to be comprehensive. Problems with the conceptualisation and execution of the MDGs arise at the goal, target, and indicator levels. This feature is shared by diff erent MDGs, and some goals have problems at more than one level. Broadly speaking, problems associated with the level of goals seem to relate to their being too narrow and fragmented, leaving gaps in which other important development objectives are missing. Problems at the target level often relate to their being incomplete or partial relative to the ambition of the goal, imprecise, or without a process of delivery. These problems tend to amplify the vertical nature of some goals, widening the gaps between them and reducing connectedness. Between 2005 and 2008, MDGs 1, 3, and 5 added targets aimed specifi cally at fi lling such gaps. Problems with indicators tend to be associated with measurement, ownership, or leadership. New indicators added during the course of the MDGs are especially prone to these problems.\\n\\nProblems with goals\\n\\nAs we noted in part 1, the MDGs represent a subset of a broader development vision expressed in the Millennium Declaration. Goals were never developed for several key objectives of the Declaration, including peace, security and disarmament, and human rights. The elements taken into the MDGs were in fact the specifi c targets associated with only one objective of the Declaration, that of development and poverty eradication. Some of these goals, being themselves derived from specifi c targets, were very narrow in conception: education goals focused mainly on primary education, whereas health goals focused only on three aspects of health associated with maternal mortality, child mortality, and specifi c diseases. For goals that were more broadly defi ned, such as poverty reduction, gender, or environmental sustainability, the few targets assigned to them did not capture their breadth. The consequences of building goals around targets were two-fold. First, very substantial gaps existed in the coverage of goals, with targets failing to address important development needs for that sector. Second, because narrow goals and targets were so fragmented, the potential linkages and synergies that exist between diff erent sectors proved diffi cult to exploit.Gaps in goals could have contributed to underinvestment in areas that are key to realisation of the MDGs\\' overall development vision. For instance, considering that most of the world\\'s poor people are rural farmers, and that agricultural production and its distribution are key factors in reducing hunger, the absence of agricultural targets from MDG 1 is striking. Did this leave us unprepared for the food price crisis of 2007 and the need to make food security a global agenda? The focus of MDG 2 on primary education and enrolment has led in some countries to a so-called policy myopia, and a neglect of both learning level achievement and of secondary and post-secondary education, with important implications for economic growth. MDG 3\\'s very narrow scope failed to capture several intrinsic women\\'s rights issues such as freedom from violence and adult literacy, which are two areas of extreme inequality. In some cases, these gaps have been addressed by additional targets, but these late additions, relative to original targets, tend not to have leadership or easily measured indicators (table 1).Urban and Sumner 32 identify the lack of attention to tackling climate change (which receives little mention in MDG 7) as one of the fundamental criticisms of the MDG framework. Similar to the examples above, its limited emphasis in the MDGs could be indicative of political sensitivity or lack of eff ective advocacy, but it also draws attention to the extent to which development priorities change over time, and the challenges facing a fi xed set of development goals.Problems with targets delivering goals Problems with indicators delivering targets For example, by targeting largely primary education, MDG 2 underdevelops secondary and tertiary education, for which opportunities to create substantial improvements in incomes and in health are greatest. These educational levels also generate the skilled workers that are needed to promote and service the non-education MDGs-in health, agriculture, water and sanitation, and environmental sustainability-and teachers for the achievement of MDG 2.Similarly, the little focus on nutrition within the MDGs fails to exploit the synergy of increasing household food security, improving children\\'s capacity to participate in and benefi t from education, and increasing resilience to maternal and infant disease threats. Table 2 shows some of the links between education, health, poverty reduction, and gender goals, from which it will be clear that many are unrealised in the present MDG framework because of the narrowness of MDG targeting.The interactions between education, poverty reduction, health, and gender are complex. Primary education provides access to higher levels of education, which raises earnings, 37, 38 while higher levels of female education lead to improvements in child health care. 39 These fi ndings indicate clear gains in poverty reduction through investments in education. But education\\'s relations with poverty, health, and gender are reciprocal. Children from poorer households enrol in fewer years of education, and in many systems poor girls enrol in fewer years than do poor boys. 9 Better child health and nutrition improve educational outcomes. 40, 41 These gender interactions are typical of those across the MDGs. Jones and colleagues 42 have shown how the failure to disaggregate data for men and women for poverty and sustainable development masks the gender dynamics of poverty, making the point that all stakeholders should \"champion the importance of gender equality as a cross-cutting issue that needs to be considered in all pro-poor policy and programming, including those aimed at MDG achievement\".In the present MDG process, some positive interaction will inevitably arise from the independent pursuit of diff erent MDG goals and targets, but even this interaction will need local interventions in poverty reduction, health, education, and gender equality coming together for the same groups of people. This convergence is made less likely by the reality that goals are compartmentalised into responsibilities of diff erent line ministries nationally, subnationally, and locally, which means that the potential for simultaneous actions in the same location, working with the same communities and households, is unlikely.Problems with targets delivering goals Problems with indicators delivering targets (Continued from previous page) \\n\\nFragmentation and lack of synergy\\n\\nThe gaps created by the fragmentation of goals and targets not only emphasise the omission of important development needs, but also fail to realise effi ciencies and even synergies arising from the potential links between goals. The narrow focus of the three health goals, MDGs 4, 5, and 6, tends to encourage vertical organisation of planning, fi nancing, procurement, delivery, monitoring, and reporting without suffi cient linkage or integration with the broader health system. 33 A lack of integration and effi ciency can be seen internationally, with UN agencies or departments competing for attention and funding (some of which predated the creation of the MDGs); nationally with diff erent rewards and incentives for staff in diff erent programmes; and at the level of service delivery, for which particular programmes might have more generous space, equipment, or staffi ng levels than others, although the extent of this problem varies substantially across settings. Few of the technical interventions needed to achieve these three MDGs are logically or most costeff ectively delivered on their own. 34 Most health-service delivery is multipurpose and depends on horizontal systems, including the physical infrastructure, personnel, procurement and governance policies, and audit and monitoring systems.We are not saying that health systems do not need specifi c specialised services to address particular diseases such as HIV/AIDS, but that such services, although necessary, are not suffi cient to ensure sustainable health improvement into the future, with the exception of health improvement related to the very few diseases that can be eradicated, such as smallpox. Although investment in vertical health programmes could bring resources, such as new health centres, that benefi t health systems overall, their focus on particular diseases means that other national needs might be unsupported. For example, a study in Mali found that a campaign to treat neglected tropical diseases disrupted basic health services at health centres because of staff absences; and in 14 of 16 health centres staff were overburdened by the additional requirements of the campaign. 35 Similarly, vertical programmes bring investment in accounting and procurement services that could strengthen national health systems generally, but which could in practice be limited to servicing specifi c disease programmes, running in parallel to weak national systems. In countries where human resources are scarce, such as most low-income countries, staff move to where salaries, incentives, and working conditions are best. Thus although allocation for disease-specifi c funding might increase human resources in health systems, human resources might be drawn into specifi c programmes, neglecting other parts of the health system.Eff ective health systems need both vertical and horizontal components, and the MDGs have focused investment on the former, with the result that global health initiatives (GHIs) established with mandates to address specifi c diseases (such as The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; or the US President\\'s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief [PEPFAR]) or tightly focused objectives (such as the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation) have had a variable eff ect on improving national health systems. 36 Several of these GHIs are now working to broaden their remit to address the horizontal aspects of health-system strengthening more directly.The narrowness of MDG goals and targets also does not realise effi ciencies and synergies between sectors.\\n\\nTable 1: Goals and targets for MDGs 1-7, with observations on diffi culties with conceptualisation and execution\\n\\nHowever, precedents for such synergy can arise from targeted interventions in the same communities. For example, the Mid-day Meal programme reaches 120 million primary school children every school day in India and provides a cooked meal. The introduction of this nutrition programme has greatly raised school attendance 43 and, in conjunction with agricultural services, can stimulate farm input and output markets and agricultural development. Environmental sustainability should be a cross-cutting goal with potentials for synergy across sectors. However, MDG 7 targets 7A and 7B are not expressed in a way that links them to human welfare and development, making such linkage diffi cult. This shortcoming could be addressed with the concept of ecosystem services, whose development in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment paralleled the implementation of the MDGs. The role of ecosystems services is refl ected in the need for sustainable provision of water, soil, and biodiversity services to support agriculture and achievement of MDG 1 targets, and the importance of environmental factors to improved health. For example, 24% of the global disease burden is estimated to be associated with environmental factors, and 25% of all deaths in developing countries are linked to environmental risks. 44 The fragmentation of the MDGs has probably resulted in several lost opportunities to improve development outcomes. At its heart, of course, is the longstanding fragmentation of most human knowledge and activity into so-called sectoral \"silos\"-such as health, education, environment, etc-and even into separate silos within sectors, as seen clearly with health targets spread across MDGs 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. At the intergovernmental and intragovernmental level, this isolation is reinforced by a long tradition of institutional ownership and disciplinary identities that are embedded in professional qualifi cation systems, societies, and journals. By simply gathering together established goals and targets of these diff erent development communities, the MDGs could not hope to achieve the desired integrated approach that is appropriate to complex problems in international development. Worse, by fostering traditional and institutional ownership of diff erent MDG goals, the MDGs reinforced their isolation.\\n\\nProblems with targets and their indicators\\n\\nWe now consider the extent to which MDG targets and indicators have been designed to deliver its goals eff ectively. The use of a results-based framework is regarded as one of the strengths of the MDGs, and has certainly appealed in an aid context with the desire of donors to see measurable returns on investment. A focus on measurable MDG results does, however, mean that indicators are selected that capture neither the complexity of the target, because of the need for parsimony, nor the qualitative nature of much development progress. As indicated in the review of individual MDGs (webappendix) and table 1, this problem is common to many MDGs. MDG 2 provides a particularly clear example of how specifi c targets can be met without achieving their full intent. For this goal, the measurable target identifi ed for achievement of universal primary education is to ensure that, by 2015, all boys and girls are able to complete a full course of primary schooling. This target is accompanied by three indicators, of which only the fi rst, the net enrolment ratio, has been consistently measured, because the others are more diffi cult to assess. Hence progress on MDG 2 has been represented by changes in this ratio. However, this measure entails a very narrow view of primary education. In some contexts, enrolment in education, even in the last grade of primary, can mean\\n\\nEff ect on education Eff ect on health Eff ect on poverty and hunger reduction\\n\\nEff ect on gender equality Improvement in education .. Encourages good health practices, delays marriage, reduces fertility and child mortality, and improves maternal health; primary education provides access to secondary and post-secondary education and skilled health workers Improves agricultural productivity and off -farm employment opportunities; primary education provides access to secondary and post-secondary education and generates a skilled workforce Once targets are seen to be achieved, attention may be directed elsewhere. If target achievement falls short of goal achievement, then it is possible that further progress will not be made against that goal. In panel 3, we show this risk with an example of MDG 3 from South Africa.In conclusion, targets and their indicators frequently fall short of being meaningful measures of MDG achievement-for instance in MDG 2 with the net enrolment ratio as a proxy for education, in MDG 1 with income as a proxy for poverty reduction, and in MDG 3 with gender equity in schools as a proxy for societal change in gender equity. This criticism might seem rather severe-specifi c targets and indicators were never meant to measure all progress against a complex goal. Rather, they were meant to be indicative of progress. The risk, however, is that once targets and indicators become established, their indicative function is forgotten, and they become the end, not the means, of the MDGs. Such goal displacement, in which targets and indicators become more important than achievement of goals, is a common feature in management.A feature of MDG targets that has often been seen as a virtue is their caution not to prescribe how a target or its indicators should be achieved, although some are a partial means to a goal. This approach has mostly worked, insofar as a target for disease reduction or education, for example, is adopted by a particular development community which will identify or already have in place strategies for achieving it, as was the case for MDG 2. Nevertheless, this ownership of targets also fosters territorial attitudes.However, too little detail has proven to be a problem for other MDGs. MDG 1, for example, with its goal of halving poverty and hunger, does not have any indicators concerned with service access or with policy interventions. As with other goals, it has results-based outcome targets, relating to proportions of people above income thresholds, in employment, and underweight at a particular age, but no targets for mechanisms contributing to these outcomes-ie, it has no output targets. MDG 7 has a similar problem in that it has targets that encourage policies which reduce the loss of biodiversity and other natural resources, as outcomes, but it has no output targets in terms of policy interventions. Targets with these problems have less chance of eff ective execution than do others, since they are based only on observation of outcomes.The results-based nature of the MDG framework means that availability of good quality data is necessary to the use of specifi c indicators that monitor progress towards targets and goals. But national information systems are still weak in many countries, and data, if available, are likely to be of poor quality. This problem is compounded by technical diffi culties for some of the MDGs\\' indicators that might not be easy to measure yearly. For example, the number of children eligible to be enrolled in school forms the denominator of net and gross enrolment ratios. These ratios should be calculated every year, but population estimates are typically taken in a census once a decade.Our cross-MDG comparison suggests that, for most MDGs, only a few of several indicators are regularly measured and others fall away as yearly reporting progresses. The reasons are usually associated with the issues discussed in this section surrounding diffi culty of measurement, but leadership is also an issue. Where commitment to national or international measurement is limited, then indicators are rarely measured. Lack of measurement is a particular problem with more recently added targets, for instance in MDGs 1, 3, and 5, perhaps for reasons that they are either more complex or less broadly owned than others.Finally, criticism of the use of targets and indicators has to be tempered by the positive eff ect of the MDG process in stimulation of a culture of assessment, leading to investment in data collection and in monitoring and assessment in many countries, as well as regionally and subnationally. The MDGs have also inspired valuable research in the area of development eff ectiveness, which will benefi t future goal setting.\\n\\nOwnership\\n\\nThe MDG framework seemed to represent an important political consensus; that 189 countries signed up to one development plan was of huge symbolic signifi cance. It also off ered the potential to ensure national ownership Guy Collender, LIDC around global commitments. However, despite the widespread support for the MDGs internationally, to ensure ownership of the MDG process-including development and implementation-at diff erent levels and by diff erent stakeholders has been problematic.Multilateral and bilateral agencies were heavily involved in the early development of the MDG framework as it emerged from OECD DAC and UN processes. Although they were brought in at the later stages of the process, and were signatories to the MDG framework, thus agreeing to work towards their implementation, the involvement of developing countries in the initial development of the framework was small. As a result, meaningful national ownership by developing countries has been mixed and often weak. We will consider ownership of the MDGs at three levels-by the international development community, by civil society, and by national programmes in developing countries-and the problems associated with each.The principle of ownership arises from our analysis in part 2 (and particularly the lack of MDG ownership that might exist nationally), from our conceptualisation of wellbeing as including participation and voice, and from our consideration of the requirements for sustainability. Much of the discussion of ideas of global social justice focuses on the problems of attending to diff erent local, national, regional, and global communities, and the politics of articulating and negotiating very diff erent interests, 109, 110 and our method for elaboration of this conception of development has taken as a starting point the acceptance of a plurality of societies in the world.We have seen in our examples from diff erent countries that MDGs have usually been incorporated into national development programmes where they fi t local priorities. Alternatively, MDGs could stimulate a change in national priorities if donor funding for MDGs causes governments to change their strategies to take advantage of opportunities for external investment. These observations suggest a need for greater ownership of the process of goal development both nationally and internationally. Questions about who sets goals, how they are represented and legitimated, and what relationships they have with targets must be of central concern. National and local ownership and a new framework for international partnerships will be crucial for what comes next, both in terms of refl ection on the nature of global obligation and the establishment of particular goals and targets.We propose that the search for developmental goals after 2015 should begin from a comprehensive conceptualisation of development and the core development principles proposed to govern both the specifi cations of development goals and the processes by which they are specifi ed. This process should be undertaken, and its product owned, by all countries by use of forms of open discussion and public scrutiny, as suggested by Sen, 95 and we emphasise therefore that our set of principles and elements of wellbeing are only examples of what these principles and elements might look like.However, these goals might subsequently have to be narrowed or otherwise amended to achieve comprehensive commitment to the development agenda. Goal setting at this level should focus on the planning of national and local programmes by national constituencies. National priorities will diff er, but all agreed elements of wellbeing should be considered, such that diff erences refl ect local priorities. Priorities would need to be developed through an equitable process of discussion and deliberation with some agreed processes of how consensus was to be reached with regard to national priorities. Operationally, a process that is given suffi cient time to include civil society participation (and appropriate accountability processes) would be needed. A focus on local priorities would be important to ensure that targets set are locally relevant, not only national aggregates, and that they do not aim too low.National target setting would need an element of regional and global input, especially to address environmental development needs that are supranational, such as climate change adaptation and mitigation, and to address international issues such as the eff ect of trade or migration of skilled workers on human and social elements of wellbeing. A process to integrate local, national, and regional priorities to generate national, regional, and global targets will thus be needed, with mechanisms to reach consensus. Although brokering and negotiation between powerful players is one way to achieve this process, a better approach might be to adopt mechanisms that allow subsidiarity, opt outs, or variations in specifi cation of targets between global, regional, national, and subnational jurisdictions-although of course these are not without their challenges.Equally important for ownership is a mechanism to review progress towards targets that ensures national dialogue (involving governments and civil society) around the targets and the data associated with them. This mechanism could entail: independent national bodies established and tasked with monitoring progress with wide participation of a range of groups; national collection and review of data; external comparative analysis in partnership with multilateral bodies or international organisations; and national analysis and decision on action in the form of public, parliamentary, press, or other forms of debate and discussion. The changing international architecture of the UN would be an important backdrop to this process, with action to avoid the present fragmentation of development goals between diff erent UN bodies, through strong central leadership. UN agencies could assist with the circulation of information, convening of meetings 26 for crucial refl ection across countries, and identifi cation of where particular resources for initiatives might be located. But the dynamism associated with other cross-national organisations of civil society would also be an important resource.\\n\\nOwnership by the international community\\n\\nImplementation diffi culties for some MDGs are indicative of the institutional structure around the MDGs and, in some cases, lack of or confusion around ownership between diff erent UN and multilateral agencies. For instance, the absence of ownership of MDG 3 inter nationally has made it particularly diffi cult to implement. Reactions have been mixed nationally, although the decision of the Commission on the Status of Women in 2009 sought to link together the Beijing Platform of Action and advancement of MDG 3 through the work of the UN Division for the Advancement of Women. 55 Territorial issues with leadership have also aff ected implementation. This eff ect is most noticeable with health, for which the various health MDGs, by design, were mapped onto the institutional structure of health interests. The HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria professional groups, NGOs, and research community\\'s link to MDG 6; the maternal health community to MDG 5; and the child health community (with another strong professional group, the paediatricians) to MDG 4. A further, important, interest group that strengthens the position of MDG 6 relative to the others is that of the pharmaceutical industry, which has clear fi nancial interests in funding streams that are associated with the purchase of relatively costly drugs and commodities such as antiretroviral drugs, and received particular mention in MDG 8.In principle, institutional ownership should improve leadership, but this eff ect might not arise when ownership is too fragmented or when it is contested. For example, within the UN agencies, the ownership of maternal health is split, causing a scarcity of leadership for MDG 5. Within WHO, the lead technical agency, maternal health is split between Making Pregnancy Safer, the Human Reproduction Programme, and (for newborn babies) the Department for Child and Adolescent Health. Among agencies with funds for implementation, both UNICEF and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) have a role, which can be crudely defi ned as UNICEF being concerned with antenatal and postnatal care, and UNFPA with delivery care. In practice, activity depends on strengths in country. UNICEF adopts a community focus, and UNFPA staff traditionally have reproductive rather than maternal health expertise. The World Bank has played less of a lead in recent years, and a global fund does not specifi cally address maternal health. An attempt to pull together groups within the Partnership for Maternal Newborn and Child Health has been only partly successful so far, and did not always receive full backing by the UN agencies themselves.\\n\\nPanel 2: diffi culties with targets for MDG 2 in India\\n\\nThe target for MDG 2 aims to have all children completing a full course of primary schooling. For India, estimates suggest that close to 95% of children aged 6-14 years are enrolled in school. 45 The Indian Government has a policy of automatic promotion from one grade to the next each year, which implies that it is not diffi cult for enrolled children to move from grade 1 to grade 5.But is enrolment a good measure for understanding who is in school regularly? Several studies have shown that despite very high enrolment, regular attendance in school is an issue of major concern in some states. Government data from 2006 show that in 11 of the 20 major states, average attendance in primary school was less than 80%. 46 When measured very carefully, fi ndings from the SchoolTELLS study showed that for the school year 2007-08, in the schools sampled for the study, only 25% of enrolled children in Bihar and 44% in Uttar Pradesh attended school regularly. 47 The visit of researchers from Assessment Survey Evaluation Research (ASER) in 2009 to a school on a random day indicated that attendance was lower than 80% in ten of 20 major states, with numbers below 60% being recorded in populous and educationally underperforming states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. 45 In poor regions, despite incentives such as free school meals, uniforms, scholarships, and textbooks, children are not regularly in school. Stable and regular attendance patterns are an essential condition for eff ective teaching and learning. Closer tracking of attendance needs to be a high priority for state governments in India.No national longitudinal study has been done in India that follows successive cohorts of children from the fi rst year until the last year of primary school or beyond, so the primary school completion target is diffi cult to measure accurately. With the assumption that a large majority of children actually do complete primary schooling, assessment of what benefi ts the achievement of this target would represent is crucial, given that the MDG goal does not include a universal learning target. For the past 5 years the ASER survey has been measuring basic reading levels across India. ASER 2009 reports that only 52·8% of rural children in India in standard fi ve can fl uently read text at standard two level. 45 The situation for mathematics is even more dismal. Less than 40% of children in standard fi ve can do a numerical division problem (three digit by one digit division) correctly. Most states in India expect children to reach this level by the end of standard three or four. Therefore by the time that an average rural Indian child completes the primary stage she or he is at least 2-3 years academically behind where she or he is expected to be. At least half of all children in India are leaving primary school not being able to read fl uently or do basic arithmetic operations. Where does this evidence point us? What needs to be done to ensure a meaningful completion of primary school? Criteria for measurement of progress towards the completion goal have to include methods and mechanisms to assess children\\'s and teachers\\' attendance in schools regularly. Next, clear learning goals need to be articulated. It is against these benchmarks of enrolment, attendance, survival, and learning that the MDG 2 goal of completion needs to be measured.UNICEF and WHO have also had a complex relationship over involvement in, and ownership of, MDG 4. By the time that they became involved, other organisations had taken the lead in a fi eld that was traditionally theirs. Discord between WHO and UNICEF seems to have worsened during the 1990s, with WHO taking a lead role in the development and implementation of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI), while UNICEF moved into the technical leadership role that was traditionally occupied by WHO.The MDG process has largely been seen as donor driven, and issues of concern to civil society have been neglected from the agenda. This view is evident in MDG 2 with the narrowing of the Education For All agenda to the MDG agenda of Universal Primary Education, and in MDG 3 for which issues of concern to the global women\\'s movement, including violence against women, reproductive rights, and adult literacy, were not included in the targets. In this case, there was a struggle between gender and women\\'s right activists as to whether to ignore the MDGs altogether and continue mobilisation around the Beijing Platform or whether to engage tactically with the MDG process and try to secure commitment that MDG 3 would not be overlooked. 56 The mismatch between civil society agendas and those in the highly selected MDGs has implications for the ways in which civil society mobilises around the MDGs, and plays a part nationally in holding governments to account on their commitments. When particular MDGs do not include issues of concern to civil society they are unlikely to be a main focus of their advocacy eff orts, nationally or globally.The MDG discourse seems to have been used most successfully by the international community to drive for funds. Advocacy has been benefi cial and eff ective when what is wanted nationally coincides with international advocacy eff orts. This has been particularly the case in health, with the renaissance of child survival prompted by MDG 4, and with the supportive role of MDG 6 in mobilising funding for reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS.The domination of wealthy countries and their development communities in the MDG process also generates a problem of representation and asymmetry in the process of development of the MDG targets, whereby those with the money chose the targets. Although targets for poor countries are emphasised, the MDGs that by their nature involved wealthy and poor countries, MDG 7 and MDG 8, fell short of setting specifi c targets. Poverty rather than inequity is regarded as the challenge, thereby relieving wealthy countries of having targets of their own.\\n\\nNational ownership\\n\\nIn 2003, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) pronounced \"Governments, aid agencies and civil society organizations everywhere are re-orienting their work around the Goals\". 1 Indeed, many low-income countries have made an eff ort to link their own national development strategies to the MDGs, which can provide impetus for the achievement of both. Panel 4 shows how the Government of Malawi has made use of the MDGs. Other national plans that were able to be incorporated into the MDGs included Vision 2025 in Tanzania and Vision 2020 in Rwanda. 22 However, in view of the importance that donors put on the MDGs, governments might feel pressure to show progress against their specifi c targets, whatever their national priorities might be. The MDGs are frequently mentioned by ministries in the poorest countries, and are often referred to in poverty reduction strategy papers. 22, 25 Fukuda-Parr\\'s analysis of 22 such papers has shown how almost all of them mentioned the MDGs, but the focus in most countries was selective. 22 Developing countries could be merely seeking to satisfy donor expectations in their reference to MDGs in poverty reduction strategy papers, and local documents might amount to \"little more than political correctness\". 3 China presents a particularly clear case of the discrepancy between how donors and developing countries regard the MDGs. The UK Department for International Development\\'s priorities regarding China are couched in MDG discourse, particularly MDGs 2, 6, and 7, yet there is an explicit recognition that the Chinese Government does not approach the country\\'s development in the same way. 59 China does not have an overarching document such as a poverty reduction strategy paper that describes how it aims to reduce poverty and achieve the MDGs. Many of the same sectors covered in the MDGs appear in China\\'s 5-year plan for 2006-11, yet the targets diff er. For example, ambitions include average education for citizens to be increased to 9 years, and 100 million rural residents to be provided with access to safe drinking water. 60 The MDGs are an irrelevance to China\\'s own development strategy. InThe printed journal includes an image merely for illustration some cases the infl exible nature of the MDG framework, and the focus on targets rather than broader goals, has contributed to countries distancing themselves from a global agenda that is seen as irrelevant to their particular developmental situation.For low-income countries, however, the donor resources associated with the MDGs can be attractive to governments that are struggling to meet their own strategic targets. For example, the provision of antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS-an element of MDG 6-has been favoured by donors such as PEPFAR, but not always as a priority in country-led health strategies. Panel 5 shows how the national health strategy of Zambia has shifted to improve incorporation of this and other MDG targets. Although this approach could be seen as donor-driven distortion of national strategy, it also is indicative of a pragmatic national desire to develop benefi cial health strategies that have a high chance of successful implementation.If particular issues are not already regarded as priorities for governments, they might simply not be taken up, other than to fulfi l obligations for reporting of, or responding to, donor priorities. This has been a particular problem with MDGs 3 and 5 because of the low status of women. Finally, the mismatch of global goals with national circumstances or priorities could create perverse incentives that misdirect time and resources. Countries that are faced with a range of locally challenging or inappropriate targets might be inclined to focus on those actions that will contribute most to their overall MDG progress results. These actions might be directed towards population groups who are quick to respond, raising issues of equity that we will explore in the next section.A particular problem with MDG ownership is the extent to which global goals have been inappropriately interpreted as national ones. Each MDG, apart from MDG 8, has a global target to be achieved by 2015, usually set as a relative level of progress from the level in 1990 based on historical global trends. These global targets are also set without adjustment as country-level targets. They were never intended as national targets, but they have been consistently applied in this manner, ignoring local context and the intercountry diff erence in technical feasibility and fi nancial aff ordability. The application of global goals to poor African countries which were never expected individually to meet them generates defeatism and negativity locally, and \"Afropessimism\" on an international scale. 24 The linear extrapolations on which several MDG targets are based might possibly fi t the averaging that is inherent in setting global goals, but they could be entirely inappropriate as a measure of national progress. For example, the capacity to reduce child mortality rates in any country is more likely to be S-shaped than linear. 69 Initial eff orts in the presence of high mortality rates need much eff ort for modest improvements. Then as services in health systems are established, there is a phase during which substantial improvements are possible with rather less input. Finally, there is a phase in which much greater eff ort and resources are needed to make further improvements. The assumption that a similar eff ort in any country will produce a similar reduction in child mortality was naive, since experience with child mortality reduction shows that for most African countries to achieve MDG 4 will be almost impossible.\\n\\nPanel 3: Achievement of MDG 3 in South Africa\\n\\nInternationally, the MDGs act as a powerful public relations exercise. While governments have their own national goals and targets developed and responsive to a national political dynamic, pressure to meet the international development goals is particularly strong because it exposes government performance in a global arena. This pressure has the advantage of holding national political leaders to account against clearly quantifi able targets, but can also lead to governments manipulating statistics or to complacency by which targets seem to be met.One problem with ticking off the indicator for a target as a success is that it may blunt initiatives to fulfi l wider dimensions of the goal. A focus on quantity might aim to include as many people as possible in the benefi ts associated with a particular target. However, losing qualitative dimensions means that important aspects of realising the full dimensions of the goal are lost.Some aspects of this eff ect are illustrated in a study of South Africa\\'s response to MDG 3. The indicators associated with the target for MDG 3-to eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education-have been met. 9, 48 South Africa has achieved gender parity in primary net enrolment ratio, the proportion of boys and girls who complete 5 years of primary schooling, and in literacy rates in young adults. More young women are in secondary and tertiary education than are young men. But these achievements against the indicators provide only a small insight into the broader goal.Interviews undertaken with offi cials in the national Department of Education and a provincial Ministry in 2008 and 2009 as part of the Gender, Education and Global Poverty Reduction Initiatives research project indicated that South Africa was proud of having met the quantitative targets for gender parity, but that for several offi cials this was suffi cient achievement on gender issues, and that other areas should get more priority. 49 Schools are assumed to promote equity simply by having achieved parity, and so their complicity in perpetuating inequitable gender relations often goes unacknowledged. As a result, data from the Gender, Education and Global Poverty Reduction Initiatives project indicate that teachers and government offi cials locate the source of gender problems in the family, both in terms of blame and responsibility for fi nding solutions.However, several studies document how, despite policy declarations which stress the importance of gender and race equality, South African schools are sites of gender discrimination. 50 This discrimination is manifest in school regimes that do not question, but in fact reproduce, norms associated with male achievement and female subordination. The diffi culties for teachers in using the curriculum to question and change these assumptions are compounded by employment practices, which often make it diffi cult for women, who make up a large part of the teaching profession, to gain promotion. 51 Although the HIV epidemic off ered many opportunities for schools to engage in refl ection on questions of sex and gender, and some creative engagements emerged, it was often very diffi cult to challenge deeply-held assumptions. Many studies identify practices of gender-based violence in schools or associated with teachers and the policy challenges that these entail. [52] [53] [54] Clearly education policy concerned with promotion of greater equality needs to recognise the ways in which schooling encourages inequitable gendered relations and the ways in which policies and practices might themselves constitute gender relationships. Working with the MDG framework means that a country can have fulfi lled the target, but this does not always achieve the spirit of the goal.\\n\\nEquity\\n\\nThe issue of equity arose in the analysis of most MDG sectors. It is a central issue that has its roots in the initial formulation of the MDGs as poverty reduction and development goals targeted at poor countries, rather than global goals created for all countries. Issues of inequity within the MDG framework are not obvious, but they could be the most serious shortcoming of the MDGs because they associate the MDGs with minimally ameliorating major areas of need for a proportion of the population, rather than diminishing the major gaps between wealthy and poor people, both within and between countries, in ways that benefi t everyone.In this context, inequity means inequality that is unfair. Fraser 70 developed an expansive notion of gender equity that goes considerably beyond equality. She associates equity with practices that confer dignity for all, and that are against poverty, exploitation, marginalisation, and misogyny. Additionally, these practices entail fairness in relation to income and leisure time. This defi nition alerts us to inequity as a process that entails not simply assessing amounts of a particular health, income, or education goods, but also paying careful attention to the relationships associated with distribution. The MDGs enable us to focus on access to minimum levels of provision in health, education, or earnings, but they do not go far enough to address unfair social relations associated with crossing a line of minimum adequacy.Part of the diffi culty in making targets go far enough is the way in which inequity is measured. Inequity is usually described in economic terms, most frequently as wealth quintiles, based on possessions owned by the household. 71 This is a convenient approach that can be applied to information such as the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data to analyse income or consumption. In many settings, wealth quintiles eff ectively indicate other inequities within a society. They draw attention to diff erences in key markers of access and outcome between those who do and do not have material assets, which provide a mechanism to examine diff erences between countries in terms of how these assets are distributed. Some specifi c measures of inequalities in wealth have been developed, such as the Gini coeffi cient which measures the extent to which distribution of wealth is uneven. Other measures are the ratio of the incomes of the richest 10% or 20% of the population compared with the poorest 10% or 20%. 72 The use of wealth quintiles as a means to measure equity has featured explicitly in only one MDG target, MDG 1 target 1A, for which indicators include measurement of a poverty gap ratio (between lowest and highest wealth quintiles) and the share of the poorest quintile in national consumption. However, wealth quintiles have been used extensively in analyses of healthrelated MDGs undertaken by the World Bank, UNICEF, and others, 73,74 and very recently in work into the distribution of education enrolment rates. 9 But wealth, income, or consumption are not the only features of inequity. Factors such as geography and ethnic origin might be more important in identifi cation of inequities, both in access and outcome of health interventions. 75 In rural Papua New Guinea and Ethiopia, the most important determinant of access to health care, and health outcomes, may be geography. Asset indices do not always predict health outcomes. In some settings, geography, ethnic origin, or other factors might be more dominant factors. But the absence of measures that capture these other factors across diff erent societies means that these features of inequity in distribution are overlooked.Importantly, asset indices cannot inform us about the gender dynamics of wealth distribution within a household or a community. 76 Many household studies in developing countries show how little access women have to household resources. 77 This defi cit comes into sharp focus when the household is faced with an emergency, particularly a health emergency. The outcome of such an emergency, especially when children are involved, is strongly aff ected by the extent of women\\'s empowerment within a community. 76 Several studies in high-income countries show that inequality is often associated with other social ills. Wilkinson and Pickett 78 associate inequality in income with a range of aspects of ill health, such as low life expectancy, mental health problems, and obesity, and markers of social dislocation such as violence and imprisonment. They argue that societies with large gaps between rich and poor people have adverse consequences for everyone, including those who earn well. Their work and many other large-scale review studies on equalities 79 suggest that inequity means much more than inequality in income levels.The notion of equity has a universal assumption in that it benefi ts all people, not just the disadvantaged sections of society. Preservation of inequity or lack of distribution for some, while addressing suffi ciency or better for others, is not the way to maximise benefi ts for a society. Many of the targets associated with the MDGs focus on improving conditions for some, but not addressing wellbeing for all. This inequity is the case for all targets that focus on changing the proportion of people experiencing a particular hardship-eg, reducing the maternal mortality ratio or the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day. Even when these MDG targets are achieved, a proportion of the population would remain below a line of adequacy and the inequities within a society would not be resolved. Reduction of the number of people living on $1 a day or less will relieve some people from extreme poverty, but only just. If action is directed only at those near the threshold, the eff ect might be to increase inequity, pulling those accessible populations across the poverty line, thereby widening the gap between them and those still below the threshold. The fundamental inequities in income distribution will remain and will continue to erode the foundation of society.The MDG approach has led to a social policy that has focused on the easiest way to bring particular groups just above a poverty line relating to income levels, school enrolment, etc. This approach has been benefi cial for some populations, but still leaves problems of marginalisation, poverty, inequality, and little dignity for many people whose specifi c circumstances often disappear in aggregated reporting on MDG achievement. For example, in India in 2005, children achieved an average 7·5 years in school, nearly completing a cycle of primary and elementary education. Children from the richest quintile, both boys and girls, completed on average 11 years of schooling, whereas boys from the poorest quintile completed 5 years of schooling, and girls completed only 3 years. 9 Thus, although India was on track to meet the MDG 2 target, inequities in educational opportunities were being perpetuated between diff erent population groups, and between the sexes. For MDG 7, improvements in access to improved sanitation are substantial, but are also strongly associated with the wealthiest quintiles of the population. 4 Health interventions associated with MDGs 4, 5, and 6 are mainly applied through established health services, tending to favour the same individuals who have been covered by previous interventions. They might live near the road or the health post, have relatives who have been trained as health workers, or have access to information. Those who are both geographically and socially far away from the rest of the population do not receive the intervention. A district level study 80 of child mortality in Tanzania since 1988 draws attention to the fact that in a poor African country that has made admirable progress towards child survival, there is substantial variability in the progress made, and the districts that were doing well in 1988 improved at a greater rate than did the poorer districts. Thus the improved child survival that Tanzania has recorded has been at the expense of worsening geographical inequity. 80 In education, many countries have expanded access to primary education through abolishment of school fees (eg, Mozambique, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya); however, this intervention has not always meant that all costs associated with schooling are lifted from poor parents or that high-quality education is delivered. Indeed, in many countries the poorest children have the least qualifi ed and supported teachers. Often the language of instruction at school used by teachers is not the same as that which children speak at home. Families struggle to meet the hidden costs of schooling-eg, costs associated with clothing, transport, or additional tuition. 9 Free education is not necessarily associated with improved equity since other factors, such as attitudes of blame,The analysis in part 2 drew attention to inequity as a major problem arising from the formulation of some MDG goals, targets, and indicators. To go beyond these shortcomings, we see equity and fairness as a key principle for future development goal setting. Equity expresses some of the values associated with justice which we see as intrinsic to the notion of development that we have elaborated. Sen has argued that aspects of equality, whether these are related to rights to hold property, vote, or earn the same level of income, are a core component of ideas about justice in the contemporary world. 105 Although diff erences might exist with regard to what type of equality is valued or emphasised, equality in some space is a central aspiration, and the notion of equity distils the types of social relations entailed in ensuring this aim. Drawing on changing meanings of the word equity in English from the 14th century, Unterhalter 106 has identifi ed three diff erent levels of equity comprising equity from above, which needs a fair system of institutional arrangements; equity from below, which entails processes of participation and discussion; and equity from the middle, which ensures the effi cient fl ow of services, information, and investment. All three are necessary and complement each other, emphasising aspects of holism discussed in the previous section.Equity is often discussed in terms of equity of opportunity or outcome. Ensuring equity of opportunity is often associated with putting in place the institutional arrangements for managed provision of health, education, or employment services. In an economy, these services and opportunities provide employment or provide credit for investment in producing goods to generate income. In education, they include providing appropriately sited schools, making universal opportunities for school attendance, and access to the curriculum through an appropriate language policy and training suffi cient teachers. In health, provision of these services means building suffi cient health facilities, training staff , and ensuring a supply of drugs. For the environment, it means providing access to clean water and air, and harvestable natural resources resulting from the Equity of outcome provides an alternative assessment of whether personal heterogeneities have been considered in relation to health, education, or poverty elimination. Processes that can help to secure this entail attention to participation in the evaluation of services, concern with aff ordability, and adaptability of services to meet diverse circumstances. A principle of equity in development goal settings needs, therefore, to address equity of both opportunity and outcome. Achievement of a level of wellbeing for all people will need the development of a more equitable world, built on more equitable societies in which there are adequate fl ows of information, understanding, resources, training, and respect to enable diverse individuals to attain a decent quality of life. The principle of equity applies across generations (including elderly, middle aged, and young people, children, and unborn babies, and thus incorporates sustainability) and within generations (eg, across nations, social groups, and gender).Equity requires a focus on the needs of each community or country, and the particular historical, geographic, linguistic, or gender dimensions of inequity. A simple approach to this requirement in goal setting is to build into survey instruments the variables needed to analyse the true determinants of inequity in health, learning, food security, and other outcomes. These variables will usually be seen as economic (wealth quintiles), geographic (distance from a functioning service-eg, health facility or school), ethnic (belonging to a deprived or discriminated ethnic group), age-related (children, young families, elderly people), or associated with gender (touching on distributional issues inside the family and capacity to participate in the labour market or decisionmaking bodies). Information has to be disaggregated so that inequity in one parameter is not obscured by another. Once the most appropriate variable, or variables, have been identifi ed for a specifi c country, they can be incorporated into access, process, and outcome indicators and can then be monitored, both as national averages, and as markers of trends to reduce inequities.To ensure equitable outcomes, assessing equity also entails establishing processes for improved participation in collective public discussions and decision making concerning not only aspects of learning and health provision, but also all areas that aff ect people\\'s wellbeing. These include global, national, and local economic policy and political issues at all levels, and are related to the principles of ownership and obligation.\\n\\nPanel 4: National implementation of MDGs in Malawi\\n\\nMalawi has been orienting its development activities towards the achievement of the MDGs. This shift is evident from the development strategies that have been formulated by the government, the articulation of the development strategy in the budget process, and the commitment to monitor progress on the indicators of the MDGs.The MDGs in Malawi are implemented through a medium-term development strategy known as the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy for 2006-11; its overall goal is to reduce poverty through sustainable economic growth and infrastructure development. The strategy focuses on six key priority areas: agriculture and food security; irrigation and water development; transport infrastructure development; energy generation and supply; integrated rural development; and prevention and management of nutrition disorders and HIV/AIDS. 57 There is a clear articulation about how the focus on these six priority areas is to contribute to the achievement of the MDGs. The budget framework is also fully aligned to the strategy, and by implication to the achievement of the MDGs, by being framed in such a way that it refl ects expenditure allocations to pro-poor sectors in Malawi.Since 2006, Malawi has been monitoring its progress towards the achievement of the MDGs and assessment of the possibility of achieving the targets by 2020. The Government of Malawi, through the Ministry of Planning and Development Cooperation, publishes the Malawi MDGs report every year. The most recent 2008 Malawi MDGs report documents remarkable progress in many areas and projects that some of the goals are likely to be achieved by 2020. Progress has been registered in eradication of extreme poverty (MGD 1); reduction of child mortality (MGD 4); and combating of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases (MDG 6); while daunting challenges remain in improving maternal health, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equality, and empowerment of women. In terms of achieving the MDGs, the recent assessment shows that Malawi is likely to meet the 2020 target for MDGs 1, 4, 6, and 7, while MDGs 3 and 5 are unlikely to be met and MDG 2 is potentially feasible. 58The very substantial progress that has been made in MDG 1 in reduction of the proportion of the population in extreme poverty from 53·9% in 2000 to 45% in 2006 has been achieved because of several interventions-eg, the implementation of the agricultural input subsidy, introduction of social support programmes for vulnerable groups, pro-poor allocation of public expenditures, and macroeconomic management leading to positive economic growth rates in the past 5 years. These interventions have been assisted by good weather and high tobacco prices, and high political will to implement pro-poor programmes. The implementation of the agricultural input subsidy has enabled the country to produce more food, with the stunting and wasting of children younger than 5 years falling from 6·4% and 6·8%, respectively, in 2005, to 4·9% and 5·8% in 2007. Poverty reduction and food security have been at the centre of the political and development agenda of the country, and MDG 1 has added impetus to the implementation of programmes aimed at reducing poverty in the country.distancing, or marginalisation, maintain existing inequities. 81 Although some countries have worked to improve the provision of education to the poorest groups through a focus on improved teacher quality, better learning materials, and social assistance, realisation of this policy remains a challenge, particularly in schools for the poorest children. [82] [83] [84] Thus the MDGs promote an approach that might systematically exclude individuals at highest risk, achieving improvements on indicators by focusing on those populations that are easiest to reach. This is not a new occurrence. Even before the appearance of the MDGs, for example, most countries that made substantial gains in child survival between the 1980s and the 1990s achieved these gains at the expense of increasing inequity, since successive interventions targeted and excluded the same groups of children as before. 85, 86 The approach underpinning the MDGs and their targets for poverty, education, gender, health, and the environment is the attainment of a specifi c minimum standard for a proportion of the world\\'s people. There are other possible approaches that would be more equitable. For example, the target might be fully adequate provision for all, taking account for particular heterogeneities, or it might be narrowing of the gap between the most privileged and the most deprived, ensuring that no group is below a level of adequacy. A deliberate, pro-poor or human rights approach can be taken, actively addressing inequities and realising rights for the poorest people. Some countries, such as Peru, have deliberately adopted a pro-poor approach to child-survival strategies. 87 Unfortunately, such countries are the exception.In conclusion, the present MDG framework does not address inequity by maintaining a concern with just adequate provision for some, ignoring the needs of those who are too hard to reach and not addressing the diffi culties of inequality in societies that seem to have deleterious consequences for everyone, not only the poorest people. More equitable MDG targets would not only help those near the threshold, but could direct improved, rather than minimal, resources at the poorest groups.\\n\\nPart 3: framing of future development goals Introduction\\n\\nThe MDGs have had a substantial eff ect, both with respect to focusing resources and eff orts on important development objectives, and also more generally in raising public and political interest in the development agenda, engaging for the fi rst time a wide range of sectors and disciplines in a concerted eff ort. As we approach the UN Summit on Sept 20-22, 2010, the two-thirds mark towards the target date for the MDGs, attention is focused on the achievement of existing goals. But there is also much interest in what happens after 2015. Many diff erent views have been expressed about that future. Sumner 88 has suggested three broad options: (1) continue with the same MDGs, with or without a timeline (Sachs has argued for 2025); 89 (2) create new targets, perhaps locally defi ned, with or without a timeline; or (3) combine the MDGs with something new (ie, an inner core of the existing MDGs, but add new and locally defi ned targets as an outer core).Manning has responded to what happens after 2015 by emphasising the need to move beyond confl ating development with aid and to recognise the eff ect of global factors and changing international power structures. 3 The Chronic Poverty Report of 2008-09 argues for a new development agenda to include access to basic social protection for all poor and vulnerable people by 2020, universal access to post-primary education by 2020, and leading to the elimination of absolute poverty by 2025. 90 In the fi nal section of this report, we apply our cross-MDG, cross-sectoral comparison to consider the future of development goals. Hence we focus on what might come after the MDGs, in view of the MDG experience. This is not to belittle in any way the importance of trying to achieve the existing MDGs in the next 5 years. Our premise is that, whether or not present MDGs are continued, modifi ed, or replaced after 2015, we should move forward having learned the lessons of the previous 15 years, and addressed any weaknesses that have become apparent in MDGs. In part 1, we examined individual MDGs and identifi ed their specifi c challenges, which we used in part 2 to draw out common challenges that cut across the goals. We found that the core challenges relate to reducing gaps and fragmentation in the MDGs, enhancing their integration, improving targeting and indicators, and ensuring equity and ownership. The reasons for fragmentation, incoherence, and gaps in the existing MDGs lie in their origins; although they included goals from a range of sectors, a common, cross-sectoral vision of development was not the basis for their formulation. Rather, as we have noted in part 1, the specifi c goals that emerged from the MDG formulation process were largely targets established in independent, earlier sectoral initiatives, grouped together and edited for political sensitivity, to maximise broad international support. Looking forward, we consider that any project after 2015 should be built on a coherent and shared approach to development, which can guide action across diff erent sectors including, but not confi ned to, addressing poverty, inequity, and environmental degradation, and improving gender equity, education, and health.\\n\\nDefi nition of development\\n\\nDevelopment is an ambiguous, multifaceted, and contested notion that in diff erent contexts and to diff erent people can describe aspirations, outcomes, or processes concerned with wider political, social, or economic change. Diff erent development approaches vary in their emphasis on these diff erent elements of developmenteg, on economic growth, modernisation, or structural change-and in their understandings of the natures of, and relations between, means and ends. Anand and Sen draw attention to helpful distinctions between ends (eg, wellbeing, freedom, and capabilities or expanded choices) and means (eg, wealth and economic growth), 91 in line, for example, with Habermas\\'s 92 diff erentiation between human forms of communication and solidarity on the one hand and highly rationalised demands for economic effi ciency on the other. They also emphasise the importance of considering universal intergenerational and intragenerational distribution together, to examine the potential for both complementary synergies (eg, in investments in maternal health and in education) and the competition for resources (eg, between present and future consumption) in discussions of sustainable development. Development invokes concerns with normative aspiration, process, and practice, which generally entail assessment.We have already considered how diff erent elements of the MDGs are compatible with, and indeed are derived from, diff erent conceptualisations of development. The MDGs are fragmented not only in their implementation but also in their underlying conceptualisations of development and overlapping of means and ends. Thus economic growth is considered in MDG 1 (or at least in the dominant concept that economic growth is the key driver of poverty reduction); MDGs 2-6 are more concerned with basic needs and human development (although MDG 3 focuses on a particular end regarding one aspect of equity); MDG 7 is concerned with both environmental sustainability and basic needs (of sanitation and urban dwellings); whereas MDG 8 mainly addresses structural issues in international trading and fi nancial systems and relations (although targets measure these in terms of Offi cial Development Assistance [ODA] fl ows, tariff s and subsidies aff ecting trade, and debt relief). While this approach captures a range of development perspectives, it generates a poorly aligned mixture of means, ends, and sometimes competing ideas about normative aspiration (eg, economic growth vs sustainability), which has made the MDG project less useful than it could have been, since opportunities to link the goals together coherently have been missed and a rigorous approach to assessment has been overlooked.Building on both our cross-sectoral analysis of the MDGs and other multidimensional understandings of development concerned with economic growth, livelihoods, entitlements and capabilities, equity, environmental and ecosystem services, and institutions, 93,94 we put forward an overarching conceptualisation of development that derives from an assessment of existing choices, and a clearer articulation of the relation of ends In 1992, Zambia began implementing Health Sector Reform, with the vision to \"provide the people of Zambia with equity of access to cost-eff ective, quality healthcare as close to the family as possible\" guided by the NHSP. Although the 2001-05 NHSP reaffi rmed the health vision, principles, and overall health goals of the Health Sector Reforms, 61 the theme adopted for the 2006-10 NHSP was entitled \"Towards the Attainment of the Millennium Development Goals and National Health Priorities\", indicating close alignment with the MDGs. 62 This alignment is refl ected in the fact that seven of the 12 national health priorities focused on public health priorities whereas fi ve directly addressed the three health MDGs. 63 However, although these priority areas were specifi cally singled out for special attention, the NHSP did include other health-care interventions.Zambia\\'s strategic alignment with the MDGs has benefi ted from the increased donor support for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria that was received in the fi rst decade of the 21st century. The availability of fi nancial and technical resources from donors such as the Global Fund, the President\\'s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the World Bank\\'s Zambia National Response to HIV/AIDS (ZANARA) programme, among others, underpinned to a large extent the progress that has been documented towards attainment of MDG 6 directly. Particularly striking has been the progress made towards achievement of universal access to treatment for HIV/AIDS for all those who need it. By the end of 2008, 200 435 adults were estimated to be receiving antiretroviral drugs, representing 66·3% of the estimated need. 63 However, although the prevalence of HIV fell slightly to 14·3% in 2007 64 compared with 15·6% in 2002, 65 the results of the 2009 epidemiological synthesis study suggest continued transmission of infection, with 1·6% of the adult population becoming newly infected every year. 66 This fi nding implies that to get close to attainment of the 2015 targets there needs to be a renewed focus on prevention of new infections. The National Prevention Strategy articulates the key drivers of the epidemic in Zambia and will guide the prevention eff orts in the next 5 years. 67 Overall, the 2008 National Progress Report on the MDGs suggests that, with the exception of MDG 7, the country is likely or potentially likely to attain the MDGs by 2015. 68 However, continued reliance on external donor support implies that the sector is vulnerable to the global economic climate, as has been experienced in 2009. The ability to maintain any gains in health indicators after 2015 needs planning that will target the long-term sustainable development of the economy. and means. Hence, we are seeking to make operational some of the ideas that Amartya Sen outlines in The Idea of Justice. 95 Sen\\'s argument is that elaboration of a vision of global justice at the present moment, when there are no appropriate institutions to deliver this vision, might be deemed an exercise in ideal theory; however, it is nonetheless important to focus on the choices that are actually on off er in a globally inter-related world, the plurality of principles and inter pretations that might play a part in view of the diff erent histories and contexts of people, and the permissibility of partial resolutions (ie, that making some things a bit better rather than waiting for the best resolution) could be an important step. Sen also emphasises public reasoning and attention to assessment of human lives in terms of capabilitiesie, reasoned values and the signifi cance accorded by these factors.Drawing from this method of assessment of existing human relationships, and identifi cation of means and ends, we defi ne development as a dynamic process involving sustainable and equitable access to improved wellbeing. This conceptualisation needs brief elaboration. There are many elements of wellbeing and increasing published work on its application and measurement. 92, 96, 97 Sen views wellbeing as a combination of the aspiration that \"human lives can go much better\" and an understanding that improvement can be brought about through a strengthening of human agency, a person\\'s capability to pursue and realise things that he or she values and has reason to value. 98 Unlike conventional economics that equate wellbeing with happiness, Sen\\'s capability approach suggests that aspects of wellbeing have to consider the things that we really value (whether they make us happy or not) and levels of deprivation, whether or not people report they are happy despite severe want. By suggesting that wellbeing is linked with capabilities-that is the freedom to enjoy various combinations of beings and doings-Sen draws attention to the signifi cance of how diff erent people necessarily have need of and make use of resources in diverse ways. 97 To consider heterogeneity as part of any evaluation of the freedom people have is therefore crucial. Social arrangements for development are thus to be assessed not in the space of resources (inputs) or of outcomes (happiness) but in relation to wellbeing, agency, and capabilities-that is the freedom to promote and achieve functionings that people value. In adoption of an understanding of wellbeing that derives from Sen\\'s ideas, we defi ne wellbeing as the freedoms and capability to make choices and act eff ectively with respect to, for example, health, education, nutrition, employment, security, participation, voice, consumption, and the claiming of rights. For each of these elements of wellbeing, there are important considerations of quality and quantity of achievement, of diversity in aspirations between diff erent communities, of equity, and in some of these aspects (most notably those concerned with material consumption) of the need to recognise satisfaction from suffi cient (as opposed to maximised) achievement, as diminishing marginal returns to consumption are overtaken by increasing marginal costs (including social costs). This approach helps access to improved wellbeing to be both equitable and sustainable. In this section we will discuss the nature and implications of equity and sustainability, but note here their importance as intrinsic features of our development notion.Sustainable and equitable improvements in wellbeing are achieved by expanding access to services that deliver the diff erent elements of wellbeing. The classifi cation of services provided by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 99 is particularly useful, since it makes a distinction between moderating (or regulating), provisioning, supportive, and cultural services. This typology has wider applicability beyond the provision of The printed journal includes an image merely for illustration ecosystem services by natural capital (eg, forests, soils, wetlands, oceans). Thus physical capital (eg, infrastructure and equipment), human capital (eg, knowledge, skills, labour), and social capital (eg, institutions, relationships) all generate moderating (or regulatory) services that provide stability, promote resilience, and reduce systems\\' sensitivity to change. Similarly, these diff erent types of capital also generate provisioning or productive services (producing goods and services for direct or indirect consumption), supporting services (supporting conditions necessary for and underpinning systems\\' existence and functioning), and cultural services (which provide communicative, aesthetic, recreational, or spiritual benefi ts). Finally, development has to be explicitly and fundamentally seen as a dynamic process of change. This view involves a plurality of perspectives with several stakeholders, who interact as individuals within and between households, organisations, communities, and nations, with diff ering resources and aspirations. Embedded and emergent properties in systems operating at these diff erent scales mean that changes and transformations within them are interdependent and highly complex. 93 This conceptualisation of development extends beyond that implicit in the MDGs, for which MDGs 1-6 in particular are focused on poverty reduction and the achievement of limited, indeed minimalist, standards of welfare, 13 with little emphasis on wider notions of development or on the condition of people who are not affl icted by extreme poverty. Our notion addresses issues that need commitment and action across countries of low, middle, and high income. In view of the arbitrary nature of the cutoff points in many classifi cations of poor and non-poor people, and the moral arguments that all people have an equal right to aspire to much more than escape from narrow and arbitrarily defi ned levels of poverty, we believe that development goals should extend beyond, but include, minimalist poverty reduction and survival goals.Our notion also diff ers from the MDGs in another way. Gore 13, 100 has suggested that the development of the present MDGs represented a switch from a procedural approach to development (involving common respect for rules, norms, and practices governing relations) to a distinctly purposive approach, involving the achievement of specifi c, agreed outcomes. Our notion incorporates both of these elements-it is purposive in that it identifi es elements of wellbeing as targets to be achieved, and it is procedural in that it places strong emphasis on equitable, sustainable, owned, and scaled processes. Importantly, it adopts a holistic, maximalist approach while recognising that minimalist standards have a role.However, this broader conceptualisation of development could threaten a core feature of the MDGs that has allowed them, individually and collectively, to achieve a high degree of international consensus and commitment. Only by limiting the scope of the MDGs and accepting gaps resulting from the omission of politically sensitive issues could parsimony and broad agreement be reached. Further, this agreement was reached building on some of the optimistic realignments of the 1990s in the aftermath of the end of the Cold War as a centralised process led by more powerful players with a pragmatic acceptance of the lowest common set of goals and indicators, defi ned to allow sometimes loose and sometimes narrow interpretations. However, any future project to develop the MDGs will be located in a very diff erent global political economy characterised by the events after Sept 11, 2001 , the emergence of a new security agenda, the eff ects of the fi nancial crises, the emergence of China and India as signifi cant economic and geopolitical players, and extreme caution about what global agreements can achieve in view of the failures of the Doha round on trade agreements and the Copenhagen conference on climate change.Building on a broader notion of development should therefore recognise this history and address the dilemma posed by likely trade-off s between a comprehensive set of development goals, and comprehensive commitment to these goals. This approach will not be easy, but several development issues make the MDGs\\' focus on a set of goals aimed at increasing the material consumption of poor people less tenable. We draw attention to, for example, a growing acceptance of the need to address population growth, to recognise and restrict the environmental eff ect of human activities, and to understand the limitations of growth based on capitalism and neo-liberalism as a system for delivery of sustainable development. These issues have been ones for which comprehensive agreement is diffi cult to obtain from states with diff erent ideologies and political systems, but they can no longer be avoided. Unterhalter and Carpentier 101 set out this challenge in terms of a so-called development tetralemma faced in the pursuit of mechanisms and systems that simultaneously promote equity, growth, democracy, and sustainability (in which a tetralemma is defi ned as analogous to a dilemma, but involving a set of four crucially important options for which each is necessary but not suffi cient for sustainable development, and they cannot all be achieved together). Almost all present political and economic mechanisms and systems can only achieve some of these at the expense of others; hence they are compromised even in their initial achievements. Experience of the Copenhagen negotiations in December, 2009, on climate change targets and measures shows the diffi culties in getting international agreements on complex and politically sensitive issues aff ecting international and intergenerational investments and concerned with countries\\' diff ering and evolving domestic aspirations and perceptions of rights and responsibilities. 102, 103 Guiding principles for development goalsWe suggest that a more comprehensive concept for development should and can form the basis of a development project after 2015, if that project follows fi ve guiding principles. We derive these principles from our development notion above, and from our analysis in part 2 of the MDGs\\' strengths and weaknesses. They are: holism, equity, sustainability, ownership, and global obligation. We examine each of these in turn, but emphasise that they are not independent of each other, but closely interwoven.\\n\\nHolism\\n\\nBy holism we mean the need to avoid gaps in a development agenda and realise synergies between its components. We emphasised in part 2 of this report both gaps in the MDGs and the way that their separation contributes to a failure to achieve integration and synergy between the elements that contribute to improved wellbeing. Figure 1 shows how this tenet can be viewed in terms of three core dimensions of wellbeing. It suggests that people\\'s wellbeing and capabilities depend on human development (change in their individual human conditions and resources), social development (change in their social relations and resources), and environmental development (change in their access to and relations with natural and environmental resources). Progress on each of these areas is crucial for people\\'s wellbeing, but they are also closely related to and dependent on each other. A formulation of development goals should start from these individual and interlinked dimensions. We also note that achievement of human, social, and environmental development as set out in fi gure 1 is dependent on underpinning development of physical capital and, in view of the global challenges noted earlier, population stabilisation. Neither of these are themselves core dimensions of wellbeing, but both are important for human, social, and environmental development.The general identifi cation of human, social, and environmental development as core dimensions for achievement of wellbeing is important for a holistic conceptualisation of development processes and outcomes, but it is too broad to be a practicable focus for development policy and action. For this approach we need to consider more specifi c elements that are necessary means and ends to achieve contributors to human, social, and environmental development and, as a result, wellbeing. These factors could be confi gured in many ways. By means of illustration, we present one set in fi gure 2.Some of these elements clearly resemble existing MDGs. Some are presented diff erently to address some of the weaknesses that we have identifi ed in the MDGseg, the lack of focus on learning, and the lack of the integration of health areas. Others represent areas excluded from the MDGs, such as human rights. An important feature of each of these elements is that it contributes directly or indirectly to human, social, and environmental development. The elements are holistic and interlinked and represent areas in which we can realistically in Sen\\'s terms \"do more and do better\". 104 Access to water, for example, delivers human, social, and environmental elements of wellbeing, through water for drinking and sanitation, societal agreements on water sharing and use, and sustainable use of watersheds and management of pollution, respectively.The absence of explicit reference to economic development or growth or to markets from fi gures 1 and 2 is not intended to suggest that economic growth is not important in development. Indeed it is crucial for funding investments in the delivery of services for most of the elements in fi gure 2, and underpins participation in and enjoyment of livelihoods (and employment) by which people both contribute to and access services from the local and wider communities of which they are a part. However, the dimensions and elements of development in fi gures 1 and 2 are higher level development ends, in whose pursuit economic development and growth are important means. Furthermore, the importance, nature, and extent of economic growth, and the roles of markets, governments, and other institutions (eg, civil society) in achievement of these ends are context specifi c. Thus growth is less important in more wealthy economies, where more attention might be needed for issues of sustainability and reducing the negative eff ects of material consumption on the environment. In poorer economies, however, economic growth is likely to be more important.We present the elements in fi gure 2 as indicative. They might not describe all the essential elements contributing to wellbeing, or they could be confi gured or combined better-any changes or additions need to be considered in a similarly interlinked approach. Further, we do not propose these elements as a list of future MDGs. In view of experience so far, expansion of MDGs from eight to 13, and adding the targets and indicators that achieved the linkages intended, might considerably weaken the virtue Overarching ends Dimensions of parsimony in attracting public attention and fi nancial investment (although the pursuit of synergies might also allow some reduction in targets per goal).Prioritisation would be a process with a strong political element, as with the existing MDGs. We emphasise here that any selection of priorities for targeting should be done through an approach that identifi es the elements that deliver most human, social, and environmental development, and, in subselecting from these elements, recognise and accommodate as best as possible the gaps that will arise and the linkages that such gaps might threaten. We suggest that this approach would be better than assembling specifi c, independent goals to make a development agenda, as was done with the present MDGs, with retrospective fi lling in of gaps and making of linkages-a process that has had limited success because of complexity and lack of ownership.Another aspect of a holistic approach to development goal setting concerns operational choices in delivery of services. In this approach, holism suggests that there has to be the opportunity for co-action across elements and synergies in relation to service access for individuals and communities. The absence of this, for example, with interventions in health in one part of a country and interventions in education in another, could contribute to marginal, sectoral increases in wellbeing, but fail to capture the added gains from joint investments in education and health in the same groups of people (eg, improved health services reduce children\\'s absences from school and improve their participation and concentration at school, while education can improve uptake of health services).However, we realise that one practical consequence of this operational application of the principle of holism might be a potential confl ict with our principle of equity.Undertaking a series of intervention programmes addressing diff erent areas for action in the same localities with the same households could yield large benefi ts for these households and communities. However, it would be unfair and inequitable if at the same time other poor localities missed out on all interventions because resources were insuffi cient. Thus, to continue with our example above, added investment in education in one part of the country and added investment in health in another might seem to be more equitable, but such equity might be achieved at the cost of losses in eff ectiveness and effi ciency. Nonetheless, working with Sen\\'s advocacy of partial resolutions submitted for public scrutiny might allow for these rationales to be assessed. 94 \\n\\nSustainability\\n\\nSustainability was not explicitly or implicitly addressed in the MDGs, apart from in MDG 7 from the perspective of environmental sustainability and sustainable development. These two diff erent notions-the fi rst relating to protection of ecosystem function and services, and the second to economic growth that protects the opportunities of future generations 107 -are important features of a comprehensive development concept. However, sustainable wellbeing is broader than both these ideas.We defi ne sustainability of a system that delivers an outcome, such as wellbeing, in terms of its capacity to persist, and to resist or recover from shocks that aff ect its productivity. 108 Sustainability is an important feature of the diff erent development dimensions and elements identifi ed earlier; economic and fi nancial sustainability arises particularly from processes of social development, and from human and environmental development. Sustainable action should be a practice of all stakeholders who have power over the resources a system uses, and it will apply to all scales (eg, from households to nations, from fi elds and small stream catchments to river basins). Such sustainable action is hard to achieve, but is made easier when diff erent services can substitute for each other to improve sustainability. For example, the sustainability of nutrition as an element of wellbeing can be supported by development of improved agricultural and environmental systems, by improved trade and the equitable distribution of foodstuff s, or by changes in personal livelihoods or behaviour that give individuals more reserves to survive periods of want. And sustainable wellbeing depends on children and young people learning how to learn in order to make full use of improved agricultural, environmental, and distribution systems, and to develop resistance to shocks in health and income in the future.A broad but clear understanding of the role of productivity is crucial to understand sustainability. Productivity needs to be defi ned in terms of a system\\'s delivery of the provisioning, supportive, regulating, and cultural services that we discussed earlier. Not only does productivity have to be viable in material terms (not depleting resources below stocks needed for the system to operate), it also has to be both viable and acceptable in social and economic terms. Therefore, all stakeholders with (formal or informal) control over resources need to have the ability and incentives to support the maintenance of the system. We draw attention to two implications from this tenet. First, growth in productivity is crucial for the sustainability of many systems, but not a necessary feature of all systems, and the nature and rate of growth needed in a system will vary with the aspirations of stakeholders, changing pressures on systems, and socioeconomic structures and relations. Thus increasing population and aspirations for substantial improvements in wellbeing for poor people makes strong demands for productivity growth, but economic growth associated with increases in material consumption will not be as important for some advanced economies and their sustainability. This notion brings us back to our discussion in part 2 of this report of targets and the important, but widely misunderstood, distinction between global and national targets. Although the sustainability of the planet needs substantial reductions in productivity growth globally, the poorest countries might need to achieve high productivity growth to raise the incomes of the poorest. Second, both equity and ownership are needed in the management of systems and the returns that they off er to diff erent stakeholders. Failure of crucial stakeholders to perceive that they or others benefi t fairly from a system will lead to their withdrawal of resources from that system and its eventual collapse. The requirements of sustainability are therefore inextricably linked with our other principles of holism, equity, ownership, and global obligation.\\n\\nGlobal obligation\\n\\nThe experience of 10 years of work on the MDGs raises serious issues for debate about global justice, both as an important area of normative discussion and in terms of institution building and practical politics. Commitment to the MDGs implicitly or explicitly involved commitments to large transfers of resources from developed to developing economies and, in MDG 8, commitments to address inequities in structural relations between countries. However, despite delivery of the resources needed to achieve some MDGs, relations between developed and developing countries are largely characterised by unmet political and fi nancial commitments from developed countries. These commitments can be attributed to a failure by political leaders and voters to recognise and own international development obligations.The question of what the nature of our obligation is to people who are not citizens of our country raises a range of complex philosophical and political challenges. 111, 112 In a particular country citizens share a government and many political, economic, cultural, and social relationships that make up everyday life. The areas of MDG focus-income, nutrition, education, health provision, water, and housing-are all areas that became the focus of state policy and practical intervention in the 20th century. Thus governments became a key locus of obligation for social protection.But there is also a long history of civil society concern with people who live beyond national borders. Global ties of affi liation take in members (or intended members) of a particular faith community, and members of a group connected by attachment to a common language or set of practices. Links beyond local or national boundaries also have connected people aff ected by particular global economic injustices, such as slavery or racism, and those who have been outraged at its practices. Women, who are often discriminated against in their own societies, express the view that they share more with women in other societies than they do their own. This view is polemically captured in Virginia Woolf\\'s statement written in the mid-1930s: \"As a woman I have no country. As a woman my country is the whole world.\"The question of the nature of global obligation in the contemporary world with regard to specifi c present MDG areas (eg, education, health, gender equality) has been much debated, [113] [114] [115] with positions ranging from the need to emphasise national priorities and processes to concerns to establish some intermixture of national decision making and global review that preserves a perspective on adequacy, fairness, and response to discrimination and deprivation. Refl ections on the failure to reach a legally binding agreement on climate change at the UN Summit in Copenhagen, in December, 2009, suggest the diffi culty of establishing truly global agreement regarding obligations beyond boundaries. Further, the focus of Copenhagen was on a subject, climate change, for which global inter-relationship of states was much more evident than can be argued for other aspects of human, social, and environmental development relating to health, livelihoods, learning, energy, etc. Yet nowadays all these elements have global dimensions that link national and local interests-a fact made particularly clear from the recent food security and fi nancial crises. In view of the enormous diffi culties of establishing an institutional architecture at the summit for any ambitious vision of global obligation with regard to climate change and its eff ects, what is the best that can be hoped for the notion of global obligation with regard to the MDGs?We argue for the importance of a position on global obligation that values human rights with respect to human, social, and environmental development. Thus our concerns with wellbeing are not just limited to the obligations we have to citizens of our own country, but to individuals everywhere. 116 However, we would also argue that the expression of these values does not dictate a particular set of responses. Indeed, the form of the response will diff er in diff erent locales, given particular histories, and present form of social and political relationships. In looking forward to a future for development goal setting, we argue for maintaining and deepening the sense of global obligation that they represent. One way to achieve this would be to deepen levels of local and regional ownership of the process. In this way the powerplay and international politicking that was evident at Copenhagen might, to some extent, be reduced.The challenge for taking forward the MDG vision entails not only developing and deepening the normative language of shared obligation on selected areas, but putting in place institutional frames and political processes that can help to build and support this process. Can UN reform address this institutional challenge for global obligation? In January, 2008, Ban Ki-moon outlined leadership on achieving the MDGs as an objective of UN reform. The Secretary-General stressed the importance of improving capacity, developing synergies, and building partnerships, 117 but the politics of achieving these aims has been very complex. The eff ects of the fi nancial crisis and fi scal austerity on the aid budgets that might fi nance this development and on the local resources that might sustain it remain unclear. A further diffi culty is that the UN\\'s hopeful aspirations for human development coexist in a globalised political economy that is marked by substantial inequality and exploitation.Finally, ensuring that the framework is seen as a global framework, rather than just one aff ecting developing countries, is important in setting a future development agenda. It means that all countries, rich and poor, have obligations and subscribe to targets for which they are accountable.\\n\\nThe future of health development goals\\n\\nIn this fi nal section we show the application of our proposed principles to one particular element of wellbeing. We have selected health, since it has been a major feature of the MDGs, being the focus of MDGs 4, 5, and 6, and an element of MDGs 1, 7, and 8. We consider how each of the principles presented in the last section might apply to the development of future health goals. In many cases, what we propose can apply equally to other elements of wellbeing-eg, energy, learning; hence this approach is very much a procedural template for all development goals.A holistic approach to health development Application of our principle of holism to health development would, fi rst, mean a greater focus on the broad health gains that can be realised through an integrated health systems approach, with a better balance between horizontal and vertical features of health action. Key areas of inequity would need particular attention, including those addressed by specifi c, present MDGs. But a more holistic approach is best built on a framework of reasonable health expectations over a lifetime, which would address present gaps and accommodate diff erences in health challenges in diff erent countries.Such a life course approach could identify the following stages and expectations: • Pregnancy: access to antenatal care; adequate maternal nutrition; protection from exposure to dangerous infections and toxins. • Infancy: a reasonable probability of survival coupled with access to a loving parental relationship; protection from death or disability attributable to malnutrition, vaccine-preventable and other infections, trauma, or other causes. • Childhood: quality primary school education; safe space for play at home and school; protection from abuse in the home environment; cognitive and social development; adequate nutrition and protection from both hunger and obesity. • Adolescence: reproductive and sexual health; increasing autonomy; self-respect; access to social security for those with learning diffi culties; fulfi lling potential. • Adulthood: access to care, diagnosis, and treatment for major causes of death and disability (childbirth, noncommunicable diseases, mental health, major infectious diseases); employment opportunities and a social welfare net. • Elderly: social inclusion; dignity in dying; dementia and disability services. These stages would be provided within the framework of a health system encompassing the building blocks of service delivery; health workforce; information; medical products, vaccines, and technologies; fi nancing; and leadership and governance (stewardship). 118 A functioning health system is the sum total of all the organisations, institutions, and resources whose primary purpose is to improve health. It should provide responsive and fi nancially fair preventive and treatment services, and population-based public health activities including community mobilisation in pursuit of health improvement. A new health development agenda would look for parallel requirements between various conditions, and seek to capitalise on synergies. For example, antenatal care services have high coverage in many settings, and are now being used to deliver malaria and HIV services. General support of cross-cutting issues such as fi nancing, governance, accountability, and some elements of human resources and information systems can also include an emphasis on accountability for progress towards spec ifi c conditions.A desirable feature of such a holistic approach with its emphasis on the life course and on the health system is its contribution to synergy with other elements of wellbeing. For example, there is implicit here a greater focus on prevention of poor health, which links with learning in childhood and adolescence in particular, and with the specifi c needs of women. Not only human, but also social and environmental dimensions of wellbeing, would be needed to address health over a life course-eg, the social capacity to provide for elderly people and the environmental capacity to ensure provision of healthy diets and reduced pollution, restricting chronic disease in adulthood.From an operational point of view, holistic health targets and interventions would need to be linked with complementary targets and interventions for other elements of wellbeing, so that these synergies were realised. For example, in the case of learning targets which relate to health, that health and learning programme interventions reach the same groups of people is important. However, educators and health workers do not have to be working alongside each other. Rather, those who plan education and health interventions should work together on how to target diff erent groups, balancing the value of coordinated action with the possibility that the groups most in need of health and education interventions might not be the same.Some interventions need planning at the household, village or local community, region, or country level, and there may for some services be economies of scale in integrated (rather than simply coordinated) service delivery. Planning for learning and health, for example, will generally need collaborative planning involving more than one line authority but a clear division of labour for subsequent implementation. Ongoing monitoring and assessment of progress, however, would often benefi t from some degree of joint action by representatives of more than one group, particularly for identifi cation of the highest risk groups. Evaluation of inequities in this area and monitoring the eff ect of interventions on these inequities should be a joint activity.The Countdown to 2015 initiative, a suprainstitutional collaborative eff ort of concerned individuals and partner organisations, provides a partial model for how linkages can be built. Together with the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health, it attempts to bring together the diverse technical health communities for the constituencies of maternal, newborn, and child health, using a continuum-of-care paradigm. Moreover, within MDGs 4 and 5, it tracks coverage levels for health interventions that are proven to reduce maternal, newborn, and child mortality. A range of indicators are assessed, from mortality eff ects, outcomes such as immunisation coverage, and health inputs (such as emergency obstetric care facilities per population), to policies such as legislation around maternity leave. Equity and health-system indicators are specifi cally addressed.\\n\\nEquity and health\\n\\nWe have identifi ed equity as relating to both intergenerational and intragenerational processes. Applied to health, intergenerational equity involves the recognition, for example, that maternal health contributes to child health, and child health and development to health later in life, including reproductive health. A socalled life course approach described above is one way, therefore, of embedding intergenerational equity in health development, since it places emphasis on actions in one generation that promote the health of subsequent generations. Environmental actions that protect healthrelated ecosystem services-eg, the provision of clean water and air-are particularly important for intergenerational equity because environmental change is so slow and diffi cult to reverse.With respect to intragenerational equity in health development, our aim is to ensure that eff orts to promote human development do not continue to leave behind the most vulnerable and marginalised individuals or communities. Therefore we advocate the use of our growing understanding of equity to focus on the most disadvantaged sections-the equivalent of a pro-poor approach. Wealth quintiles have found useful application to the MDGs, particularly with respect to poverty and health targets. 73, 74 Analyses based on this approach have been instrumental in drawing attention to the extent to which recent progress in many areas has been at the expense of growing inequity. However, when applied nationally, results based on wealth quintiles do not always seem to make sense. Sometimes this situation arises because the key drivers of inequity are factors other than economic poverty, so economic poverty might understate the disparities that exist. At other times they point to fundamental problems with the data itself, such as systematic under-reporting. In some African countries, reported levels of neonatal and infant mortality are substantially lower in the poorest quintiles than some of the wealthier ones. 119 This eff ect is almost certainly due to systematic under-reporting in the poorest and most marginalised groups, who are likely to be suspicious of young data collectors coming from the cities. Adjustment for these eff ects would produce a more accurate, but less welcome estimate of child mortality for the aff ected countries.As we have discussed previously in this report, inequity has many dimensions. Economic inequity (or poverty in its narrowest defi nition) is the most important dimension in many settings, yet it is not always captured by analyses based on wealth. From the perspective of uptake of health services, what really matters is access to cash when it is needed to take care of an unexpected illness in the family. Furthermore, the cash must be accessible for the person taking care of the sick individual-eg, a mother taking care of her child, or a woman needing ongoing treatment for a chronic disease. Too often women do not have access to cash. Thus, gender becomes an important determinant of inequity. Systematic disempowerment of women is a pervasive barrier to development in all areas, most particularly health and education. In some settings, particular ethnic groups are also disadvantaged, and unless this inequity is highlighted and understood, such groups cannot be eff ectively targeted.In some countries, geographical barriers become an important determinant of access to health and education services. Such barriers could be mountains (eg, in Ethiopia, Papua New Guinea), desert (eg, in Niger), or the sea (eg, in many small island communities in the Pacifi c). In large countries such as the Philippines, inequity can be determined diff erently in diff erent regions.To address inequity in health development, therefore, we need to improve understanding of inequities within and between communities, both nationally and subnationally. In some settings socioeconomic factors will be the main determinants of inequity, in terms of education, health, and other areas. In other settings, geographic factors, ethnic origin, or gender can be important determinants of inequity. Simple methods are needed to enable countries to decide which factors are most important for them, and to monitor inequities in health, education, and other areas by monitoring one or more of the key determinants, as interventions are being implemented. Monitoring of inequities in both opportunities and outcomes will enable countries to understand whether existing or future programmes are reducing or indeed increasing inequity. For example, in some countries, a detailed analysis of factors associated with child mortality would likely show that, although socioeconomic factors have a role, with low risk recorded in the wealthiest quintile, a more important determinant of mortality risk is living in an area with no eff ective health services. On the basis of such an analysis, the government might then elect to monitor intervention coverage and mortality in a representative sample of such areas to ensure that as mortality is reduced nationally, the equity gap between the highest risk and lowest risk groups is also narrowed. Structured yearly surveys might be needed to monitor progress.Some countries have consistently adopted a pro-equity approach. For example, Peru targeted the implementation of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI), 120 the WHO/UNICEF strategy to manage sick children, to the highest risk groups 86 -an approach that they have taken with other interventions such as the introduction of a vaccine for Haemophilus infl uenzae type b. Other countries have by contrast chosen to implement IMCI in areas already served by well functioning health systems.A fi nal and challenging feature of equity in health development is the issue of how to distribute scarce resources among a population-eg, for vaccination. Generally, the small number of children living in a very remote area will have high risk of vaccine-preventable disease, particularly diseases for which eff ective health care would greatly reduce the risk of mortality, specifi cally diarrhoeal disease and pneumonia. These issues are even starker when the health services in question are not preventive services that can be delivered through mobile services, but rather treatments that need to be accessed at unspecifi ed times. Here the costs of reaching remote areas with fi xed services can be particularly high, as refl ected in the wide quintile gaps seen for delivery care compared with immunisation, for example. 121 Short of 100% coverage, there are no absolutes. A country might be faced with a real choice of either spending the available funds trying to get 100% coverage, or accepting that 80% is quite good, and electing to use the available funds to introduce a new vaccine, such as that for rotavirus. The utilitarian approach would argue that the net benefi ts are greater if the new vaccine is introduced into the 80% of people already covered, whereas the rights-based approach would argue that the 20% of children have a right to routine vaccines and should be the fi rst priority. At higher levels of coverage this dilemma might become even more diffi cult as the cost of immunising a small number of unimmunised children might become very high, if, for example, a\\n\\nPanel 6: Development of health goals in Thailand beyond the MDGs\\n\\nThailand has achieved almost all the MDG targets well before the 2015 commitment, and introduced a concept of MDG Plus-a set of country-specifi c targets going beyond the international MDG targets. All MDG Plus targets were taken from the agreed targets in the national plans and strategies of line ministries in consultation with all relevant partners. MDG Plus is equity sensitive by going beyond national average goals, making the global MDGs a fl oor instead of a ceiling. By adopting goals and targets that are customised to local needs and priorities, MDG Plus has become a central theme in Thailand\\'s multisectoral human development movements. 122 In 2002, the MDG poverty target of halving, between 1990 and 2015, the percentage of people living in poverty was reached. 123 MDG Plus aimed to bring down poverty incidence further to less than 4% by 2009, and the continuing trend of poverty reduction suggests this target was achievable despite the unforeseen global economic crisis of 2008-09. Additionally, the percentage of people living below the food poverty line and the prevalence of the underweight in children younger than 5 years have exceeded the 2015 targets since the early 2000s. MDG Plus gave special attention to children in northern highland provinces, where there are higher rates of malnutrition, and shifted focus from protein and energy defi ciency, which were not problems, to micronutrient defi ciency and in particular iodine, iron, and vitamin A in school children.There are several lessons on how Thailand achieved the health-related MDGs and moved beyond them. The commitment of successive governments since the 1970s in investing in the health of the population, and consistent favourable economic growth, were the main determinants of the development of health-system infrastructure. 124 Huge investment in the district health system, and eff orts to protect poor and underprivileged people from catastrophic health-care costs through targeting approaches from 1975, replaced by a policy of universal coverage in 2002, contributed substantially to health achievement in both level and distribution. 125, 126 Functioning primary health care was an outcome of the national policy of extending rural health services to all subdistricts and districts, and of the policy from the 1970s of compulsory rural health services for all medical and nursing graduates. District health systems serve as a close-to-client service hub that is accessible to the vast majority of rural poor people, as refl ected in various indicators: 98% coverage of antenatal care that facilitated rapid nationwide scaling up of the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV programme within a year in 2001, 73% prevalence of modern contraceptive use, and 98% immunisation coverage of DTP3 (third dose of diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and pertussis vaccine). 127 Universal access results in very small rich-poor and urban-rural gaps of use of maternal and child health services, 128 which is a key contributor to MDG 4 and MDG 5. In 2009, more than 150 000 people living with HIV were enrolled in the universal antiretroviral programme provided by district health providers.Empirical evidence shows the equitable outcomes of the universal coverage scheme launched in 2002. For example, the tax-fi nanced universal coverage scheme is progressive, with rich people contributing a greater share of their income than poor people. The comprehensive benefi t package, free at the point of service, has produced a very low incidence of catastrophic health expenditure and impoverishment. 129 Recent inclusion of renal dialysis in the package has fostered poverty reduction. 130 Without the extensive district health system, the universal coverage policy would be mere rhetoric, in which citizen rights were ensured only on paper and poor people would be unable to access and use services.In conclusion, Thailand benefi ted from rapid economic growth and government commitment to human development to achieve the MDGs early. Eff orts are in place to ensure that development is achieved universally through locally defi ned MDG Plus goals and targets. Lessons from Thailand show that the MDGs were achieved through sustainable health-system development. Wide geographical coverage of functioning primary health care at district and subdistrict levels, and the adoption of the universality principle, are major contributors to the achievement of the health-related MDs in Thailand.helicopter is needed to reach some small isolated settlements. This dilemma is familiar to health offi cials in developing countries. Although there might be no right or wrong answers, a real analysis of the costs and benefi ts of various approaches would empower countries to make more reasoned decisions.\\n\\nOwnership and health\\n\\nThe ownership processes that we suggested above, involving integration of local, national, and regional priorities to generate national, regional, and global targets, would apply well to health and to other elements of wellbeing. On the basis of agreed health objectives in the life course, decisions could be made nationally about how these would be prioritised, on the basis of national needs and opportunities, through a process involving, ideally, local government and civil society.Goal design and setting would benefi t in some cases from support to national programmes to analyse and understand the determinants of poor health outcomes, providing such programmes with the instruments needed for truly evidence-based decision making to set priorities in health. Thus, in the area of child survival, decisions would then be less easily dominated by pressure from special interest groups, or the particular preferences of funding agencies. When a reasoned analysis based on real and valid data has indicated the most suitable approach for a country to take, donors and outside pressure groups will need to take notice. The same support would help nations to develop their own, most eff ective and appropriate indicators and methods to monitor progress. Useful models for such national ownership and development of health goals can be found in the experiences of governments that have made use of, and improved on, existing MDGs. Panel 6 shows an example of such a model in Thailand.\\n\\nGlobal obligation and health\\n\\nExercising global obligation in health development would need a commitment by wealthy countries to supporting poorer countries to improve health-service provision and thereby improve global equity of access to improved health outcomes. Donor funding would be an element, and is an important feature of the present MDGs. We suggest that more attention needs to be focused on the interactions between wealthy and poor countries that constrain poor countries from improving their own health outcomes. These interactions include addressing patterns of training and employment of health workers internationally that leaves poorer countries paying for training of health workers who then settle in wealthier countries. They also include strengthening of science and innovation systems in poorer countries so that they might play a more equitable part in developing and benefi ting from new health services and technologies. This support for developing countries might mean a greater local role in public-private partnerships for medicines development, particularly in the use of local natural resources and indigenous knowledge for development of new treatments. Or it could mean strengthening disease surveillance systems and their ownership by poorer countries to reduce their disproportionate burden of infectious diseases while improving global health security to prevent future disease pandemics.Most interventions such as these would be of mutual benefi t to all countries, improving access by all to health care and medicines. Their achievement could involve targeting based less on thresholds for specifi c outcomes in poorer countries and more on demonstrable adoption and successful implementation of policies that support equitable outcomes for all countries. In this context, work done by the World Bank on environmental policy targets for MDG 7 might be a useful model. 44 \\n\\nSustainability and health\\n\\nTo achieve the holistic expectations considered above throughout the life course needs several interlinked systems to function eff ectively. It also needs suffi cient reliable and continual funding. Over the past 17 years, there have been various attempts to calculate the costs of scaled up health care, including the Essential Health Care Package approach introduced in the World Bank\\'s World Development Report 1993, the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health 131 that addressed the health development fi nance needs for countries below a gross national product of $1200 per head, and the 2009 High Level Taskforce on Innovative International Financing for Health Systems that was concerned with all low-income countries. The Commission on Macroeconomics and\\n\\nReuters\\n\\nThe printed journal includes an image merely for illustrationHealth estimated a 2002 cost of $38 per head for a scaled up set of essential interventions for low-income countries in 2015, and calculated that $4 per head on average would need to come from external funding. The Taskforce undertook a much more comprehensive costing, and estimated a 2005 cost of $54 per head for scaled up services in 2015, with around $9 to come from external fi nancing on the assumption that donor countries lived up to their commitments to development assistance. 33, 34, 132 Both sets of analyses made assumptions on desirable levels of domestic support to health that greatly exceed present levels of government health expenditure. In view of present rates of economic growth and continuing population expansion, sustained development assistance for health and considerable additional domestic fi nance are needed if we are to move towards the collective national and international aspirations for health even over the next decades. Most health expenditure in low-income countries still comes from private, mostly out-of-pocket payments (mean of $13 per head in 2006), with domestic government budgets contributing an average of $12, and development assistance making a smaller but important contribution of $6. 33 The goal of the above health intervention and system strengthening initiatives is to plan, design, and build an effi cient, equitable, and responsive health system without the distorting eff ects and special pleading of particular interest groups. Sector-wide approaches to fi nancing encourage all interested partners, both domestic governmental and external investors, to pool their resources so that one health plan can be implemented, monitored, and reported upon. The challenge that has arisen in some countries is that when domestic budgets are tightened, and external donors do not meet their expected contributions, there are not enough resources for all. In this situation the fi xed recurrent costs, particularly salaries, still have to be met, and as a result funds for services and commodities are unavailable, leading to shortages and stock-outs even for those activities that are seen as key priorities within the plan. Thus, proponents of specifi c interventions-such as vaccination for children, or completion of tuberculosis treatment to prevent emergence of costly drug resistance-have good grounds to advocate for protected funding for a few key programmes. And so we rapidly fall back into the same discussion of disease-specifi c programmes in tension with broader system-wide strengthening of the building blocks of the health system.To escape this dichotomy, we need to move the debate beyond the fi nancial sustainability of individual countries\\' health budgets. Sustainability has to be linked to global obligation and solidarity that allows rational planning with the assumption that funding will be predictable, reliable, and increasing every year. The declarations made by governments of both rich and poor countries have to be upheld. Sub-Saharan African countries have committed to increase expenditure on health to 15% of general government expenditure, and almost all rich countries have committed to raising their development assistance to 0·7% of their gross national income as well as giving commitments to specifi c goals such as universal access to treatment for HIV, which remains a target for MDG 6 for this year. 33 Unless governments deliver on these commitments, aspirations for the holistic interpretation that we put on health and development will remain mere dreams.Sustainability for the health sector can also be considered in terms that go beyond fi nancial security, to guide investment towards areas that lead to stronger human, physical, and social capital and that build systems more likely to resist or recover from the shocks that aff ect their productivity. 108 For example, large amounts of external investment fl ow into expensive technical assistance, whereas a more sustainable approach might see that investment channelled into building local and regional expertise that could eventually replace the external support.The Global Fund now supports a large proportion of the millions of people living in the poorest countries who are taking antiretroviral therapy, and there is increasing concern about maintaining donor commitments to universal access in view of the economic uncertainties. Countries are encouraged to submit proposals that show the potential for sustainability. This criterion is expanded to encompass, among other criteria, proposals that show high-level, sustained political involvement and commitment, strengthening the various elements of national health systems, and strengthening of civil society and community systems in its diff erent components (eg, management capacity, service delivery, and infra structure), with an emphasis on key aff ected populations.The so-called killer diseases of MDG 6 are all infectious diseases, which leads to one further aspect of sustainability and health-namely, the possibility of eradication of infectious pathogens. A strong case can be made for disproportionate and unsustainable investment if there is a realistic chance that in the longer term such investment will lead to eradication of a disease and consequent gains in wellbeing (and reductions in ongoing costs). The eradication of smallpox from the world and the recent success in elimination of severe acute respiratory syndrome from human populations are notable triumphs led by WHO. However, expensive campaigns against poliomyelitis that disrupt community health services have seen recent set-backs, and the shift from control to elimination of malaria has been argued in Africa to be \"at best irrelevant and at worst counterproductive\". 133 For HIV there are ambitious mathematical models suggesting that major investment in testing and early treatment could lead to overall savings in the future by reducing transmission. 134 Thus sustainability for infectious diseases might have a diff erent tenor to sustainability for health in general, for which we need to plan for ongoing and expanding costs that can be met only by a concerted and planned eff ort to draw on both domestic and external fi nance, including from innovative sources. 34 This is especially the case as the non communicable disease burden rises as the epidemiological transition proceeds.\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nIn application of our development principles to health elements of wellbeing, we would envisage future health development goals that are focused on sustainable health systems, built around delivering health objectives across the life course. This objective would involve close linkage with learning, economic, social, and environmental elements necessary to achieving these objectives, which themselves could involve other goal development processes based on elements of improved wellbeing. From a procedural perspective, these health objectives would be agreed by international consensus, and how they were then developed into goals would be a process led at the national level, building through dialogue to a set of regional and global goals. We suggest that such goals avoid threshold-based targets and indicators that might increase inequity and instead aim to generate wellbeing for all, while taking a proactive, pro-poor approach. Global cooperation would emphasise supporting countries to achieve goals in more diverse ways than simply donor funding. Sustainability would be incorporated through a high degree of national ownership and ongoing investment in human, social, and physical capital.\\n\\nContributors\\n\\nMembers of the Lancet-LIDC Commission contributed to the development of the structure of the report, writing and commenting on drafts.
